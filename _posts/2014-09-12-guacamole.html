<p>Mexican cuisine is usually a favourite in many standard households. In my opinion, you can't fully enjoy Mexican cuisine without a handsome serving of guacamole on the side. Whether you're serving burritos, tacos or even just plain corn chips, guacamole is always a necessary compliment. It's a shame that the avocado is such a seasonal fruit as I'd love to have my own bottomless stash of them at home for a rainy day. You can usually boycott the expensive supermarkets in the Winter and grab a couple of Avocados from your local market for a much cheaper price.</p>
<p>The ripe avocados and tangy tomatoes make this guacamole super quick and easy to make. I have quite a mild palette so I only add a few pinches of cayenne pepper to mine. Depending on how game you are feel free to add as much cayenne pepper as you fancy. I recommend you keep this recipe up your sleeve so that you can impress your friends with home made guacamole at your next 'bring a plate to share' event. Accompanied with a bowl of corn chips of course.</p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<blockquote><p>2 ripe avocados<br />
2 tomatoes, finely diced<br />
1 tbsp olive oil<br />
A few pinches of cayenne pepper<br />
1/2 juice of lime<br />
Half a bunch of fresh coriander<br />
Salt &amp; Pepper to taste</p></blockquote>
<h4>Method</h4>
<ul>
<li>Wash and dice tomatoes until thin.</li>
<li>Chop off the stalk of the coriander, wash and chop.</li>
<li>Spoon the avocado out of the skin and mash avocados with a fork until you get a paste-like texture.</li>
<li>Add tomatoes, coriander, olive oil, cayenne pepper and some salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Mix to combine.</li>
<li>Serve with some Salsa corn chips or in burritos, tacos or enchiladas.</li>
</ul>
