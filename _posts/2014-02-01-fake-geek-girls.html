<p>Happy Saturday Arvo, everyone! Today's vid is by the lovely Angelina, who talks about the notion of the "fake geek girl".</p>
<p>A "fake geek girl" is a female fan (said to be conventionally attractive but, like other misogynist labels, can be applied to any female) who pretends to enjoy a particular facet of geek culture (comics, games, etc) for the attention of boys. While I'm sure that the amount of attention-seeking females is nonzero (and probably just as many as the number of attention-seeking males), the idea that just because a girl is both attractive&nbsp;<em>and</em> enjoys geek culture means that she's "faking it", is, clearly, ridonkulous.</p>
<p>The only thing I have to add though, is this hilarious post that came across my dash on tumblr one day:</p>

<p>Anyhoos, here's the video!</p>
