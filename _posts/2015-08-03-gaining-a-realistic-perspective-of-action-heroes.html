excerpt: As movies embrace violence to be "gritty" and "realistic", Adriana asks why
  we don't explore the mental health side to this extreme realism.

<p>I went to the premiere of&nbsp;<em>Mockingjay Part I</em>&nbsp;a while ago. Even though I had read the books (and fangirled over them for years), something struck me as I sat in the theatre. The film depicts Katniss through her trails and tribulations with losing someone she had come to love so dearly.&nbsp;We were&nbsp;also able to see the psychological damage that&nbsp;Katniss was going through.</p>
<p>It's so uncommon in action films to see a character experience psychological problems due to what they experienced. It was&nbsp;an amazing thing to see such realism in characters. Think about it:&nbsp;would anyone come out unscathed through the trauma that&nbsp;these characters experienced?</p>
<p>Katniss had to change who she was as a person to survive. She became a murderer - not by choice, that's for sure. The audience could see the impact that the death of killing someone had on her. In <em>Catching Fire</em>, we see Katniss plagued by nightmares of her first kill.</p>
<p>I teach, and in the playground I see kids pretending to blow each other up with imaginary guns. It's all fun and&nbsp;games. They're all pretending to be the good guys, battling and killing the baddies - and there's nothing wrong with that because <em>"we're fighting evil, miss!"</em>.</p>
<p>But what if, instead of having a comical&nbsp;view of our heroes,&nbsp;we had&nbsp;a realistic view. What if we saw&nbsp;the impact and damage that violence causes?&nbsp;To show that as humans we aren't indestructible, and it's ok to not be.</p>
<p>What if, instead of showing mental illness through our villains, we show that heroes can also be affected.</p>
<p>It was refreshing to see Tony Stark, in <em>Iron Man 3</em>, go through signs of anxiety and panic attacks. It's good to see writers letting heroes be human. They're looking into the realistic factors that occur whilst going through destructive events.</p>
<p>Mental illness should not be looked at as a weakness. It should be visible in our heroes &mdash; seen as something that could happen to anyone, even the best of us.</p>
<p>Through having the&nbsp;strongest characters in action films show what is impacting them and that they are not invincible, we will see more people relating and accepting people that have mental illness.</p>
<p>Maybe in future, there can be a possible shift in perception of mental illness. Instead of the usual "harden up" attitude people may give to one struggling, there can be an understanding and acceptance.&nbsp;All in all, wouldn't relating to one another and supporting each other be better? It is something to think about.â–¼</p>
