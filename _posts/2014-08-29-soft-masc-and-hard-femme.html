<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Most of the time it seems like fashion names are just words strung together. I mean, what even is soft grunge? How do I, a simple human, be Eldritch Goth? Why do we have pop punk and punk rock, aren&rsquo;t those types of music?</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">(Side note: this is also my response to music type names. What even is jangle pop and how does it jangle? Is anarchic rock just rock that doesn&rsquo;t believe in a system of government or is there a musical underpinning to the anarchy?)</span></p>
<p>Something I do have a handle on is <em>Soft Masc</em> and <em>Hard Femme</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Soft Masc</strong></p>
<p>This is taking traditionally &ldquo;feminine&rdquo; elements and using them to accent &ldquo;masculine&rdquo; things. Think plaiting flowers into your beard, flower-patterned doc martens, <a href="http://www.stylebeans.com/fresh-beans-new-arrivals/pastel-plaid-shirt/">pastel plaid</a>. Lots of pastels and flowers and occasional paisley accents. Men&rsquo;s shirts with lace detailing around the pockets.</p>

If I could grow a beard (or hair) like that, I would definitely fill it with roses.[/caption]</p>
<p>The idea of taking something &ldquo;masculine&rdquo; and making it gentle isn&rsquo;t really a new thing, but I am happily pleased with how mainstream it is becoming. Some days you want to look manly, and that shouldn't disrupt your colour or pattern range. Some days, guys just want <a href="http://www.thebolditalic.com/articles/3547-guys-with-fancy-lady-hair">Fancy Lady Hair</a>. Soft Masc makes this easier. (also, while all my pictures are of men, Soft Masc isn't limited to men - you too can be Soft Masc. Rock your Serious Androgynous Clothes with your pastels and your patterns. Do it.)</p>

Look at that beautiful man.[/caption]</p>
<p><strong>Hard Femme</strong></p>
<p>Hard femme is a less recent trend, although not being super old I can&rsquo;t say for certain when it started. At the core, it&rsquo;s being feminine and tough. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wDo2MOCLTk">Lipstick and cleats</a>, 50s-style dresses with spiked jackets and shoes, hot pink doc martens (or faux-doc martens) &ndash; it&rsquo;s the art of pairing things that wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily go together if you were just going for a feminine look or for something more punk, or finding items that are kind of both (<a href="http://blackmilkclothing.com/">Black Milk</a> can do this quite well).</p>

<p>Wonder Woman was probably hard femme, now I think about it.&nbsp;A chest plate, cuffs that can stop bullets, battling the forces of evil, paired with a form-fitting bodysuit and deadly diadem make you pretty hard femme.</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;hard femme&rdquo; is often used in a sense that conflates a dress style with being queer, but this isn&rsquo;t necessarily true. As I said in a <a title="Queerchat" href="https://hvngrymag.com/2014/01/24/queerchat/">much earlier post</a>, dress style has nothing to do with sexuality. This post is about the aesthetic of these ideals, not anything else!</p>
<p>You can rock whatever style you like, and if being more like Wonder Woman is your jam, try hard femme.â–¼</p>
