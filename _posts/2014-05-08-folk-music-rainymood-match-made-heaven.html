    cold Friday evening that is just so right.

<p>I'm a music nerd. If you were in search of me on a Wednesday night, you would find me at a gig by the bar, with a coke zero in hand, awkwardly tweeting my experiences with undertones of sarcasm and a dash of snarky wit. Through these &nbsp;experiences I've realized how much I love listening to music &nbsp;at home. So when the awkwardness and fear of social situations gets too much for me, there is always my iPod and comfort under the sheets.</p>
<p>What I hadn't noticed, however, was that my love for music had been without a little added ingredient. As I scrolled through the vast cyberspace that is tumblr, I came across something that I had never seen before. Something that once I found, I would never be complete without.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2fCcggNkTs&amp;list=RDzv3swBFv25s" target="_blank">The Spectacular Now</a></em>, and <a href="http://www.rainymood.com/" target="_blank"> Rainymood</a>.</p>
<p>Rainymood is a site for all pluviophiles out there.</p>
<p>Not as disturbing as it sounds, a pluviophile is a person who finds comfort in rainy days. The sound of the rain on the rooftop, the snug atmosphere that rain creates. I mean, who doesn't mind getting close and romantic to a little someone after a nice hot shower next to a roaring hot fire? It brings that whole atmosphere back again.</p>
<p>It was suggested to me that I add Rainymood in the background to the music I listening to, something quiet and full of feeling. At the time I was discovering Keaton Henson, We Are Trees and Daughter. All perfect artists to add to any Rainymood playlist.</p>
<p>So when you're feeling at your utmost worst, or need a little something to calm you down, put on a record, light a scented candle, lie down and turn on Rainymood. The effect will leave you <em>breathless. âˆ†</em></p>
