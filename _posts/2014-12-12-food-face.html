<p>Let me tell you a little story about my skin. I&rsquo;m 23 years old, and have never had bad skin &ndash; until late last year, when my skin decided it was time to hit puberty! It was bad&hellip; I even went to the extent of putting bleach &ndash; yes 5% benzoyl peroxide on my pimples overnight - which I highly recommend NOT doing as it actually burnt my skin!! The memories still haunt me. I wear makeup daily, so I became paranoid about putting anything on my skin that might make it worse. Even my facial cleaners became the enemy because I couldn&rsquo;t understand the ingredients on the bottles, and the concept of putting more harsh chemicals on my already sensitive skin just wasn&rsquo;t an option. I began routine 2am frantic internet searches for miracle skin remedies, and eventually decided to try going for an all natural solution!</p>
<p>I've found they are just tops because A) You know exactly what you are putting on your skin, B) It's good for the environment, C) It's animal friendly, and D) It's super inexpensive because you can just use what you have in your cupboard! Get your notepad out ladies, because I&rsquo;m about to share with you some of my amazing tried and true home remedies for a variety of skin types! You&rsquo;re welcome.</p>
<p><b>Honey Cleanser for acne-prone skin:</b> Honey is an antibacterial and also extremely moisturising. Use it as a mask and leave on for 15 minutes before washing off. Plus if any drips in your mouth you can enjoy a cheeky treat. Bonus!</p>
<p><b>Olive Oil Cleanser for oily skin:</b> Oil on oil you say? Crazy enough, oil actually attracts and absorbs oil! Apply to clean skin, leave on for 15mins and remove with a warm, wet towel. You won't believe how soft your skin will feel!</p>
<p><b>Avocado Mask for dry skin: </b>Avocado is great for dry and sensitive skin. Again, wear it as a mask for 10-15 minutes and remove. I find it really hard to do this one, cause I don&rsquo;t want to use up an avocado!! Try opting for this one in summer when they are more affordable.</p>
<p><b>Rolled Oats Mask for an all round pick-me-up: </b>Combine 1 cup of blended rolled oats and 1 teaspoon of honey. You can also add an egg yolk if you would like a thicker mask. Mix together and apply for 15 minutes!</p>
<p><b>Apple Cider Vinegar Toner: </b>Using raw, organic apple cider vinegar is a great alternative to using supermarket-bought toners. You can also make it in batches to keep in an old toner bottle so you have it for everyday use. To make, simply mix one part apple cider vinegar to two parts water. Ta da!</p>
<p><b>Coconut Oil and Sugar Exfoliation: </b>This one is actually amazing! Mix coconut oil with white/ brown sugar to create a moisturising and exfoliating cleaner. Softly rub your skin with the mixture for about one minute. Be sure to wash all the sugar off your face afterwards or it could clog your pores. I keep a little bowl of this mix in my bathroom and use it 2 times a week.</p>
<p><b>Clogged Pores? </b>To banish clogged pores, place a hot, wet flannel over your face for a few seconds before cleansing. This will help soften and open your pores, allowing dirt to get out.</p>
<p><b>Bonus tips: </b>Remember the number one rule of life &ndash; you are what you eat. What you put in your body is undoubtedly bound to show on your skin. Try to eat lots of good fats like avocado, nuts, fish, and/or omega 3 capsules! Essential fatty acids help produce your skin's natural oil barrier, which will keep your skin looking cleaner, plumper, younger, and most importantly - healthier!â–¼</p>
