<p class="thin">I am not a slam poet<br />
because I grew up believing that poetry is about form<br />
not content<br />
not scars of war or who suffered more,<br />
who can bare her soul the loudest to get the highest score.<br />
I refuse to masquerade my pain<br />
to wallow in my own self depreciation,<br />
self annihilation, to sacrifice meter and diction<br />
to rap about addiction and affliction<br />
to a snapping crowd<br />
who cares not about the way words sound<br />
but the way the speaker sounds when she says the words<br />
as if in the process of ripping out her heart<br />
she has ripped away the words from<br />
phonetics and semantics<br />
poetic aesthetics replaced by cheap spoken word antics.</p>
<p class="thin">I am not a slam poet<br />
because I grew up believing that beauty is about form<br />
not content.<br />
I refused food on plates, my limbs refused<br />
the pressure of weight.<br />
My muscles and sinew dissolved<br />
in hopes that lacking love would be resolved,<br />
my sins absolved, my problems solved.<br />
Every lost pound was approval gained.<br />
one morning<br />
the sun became subverted,<br />
the ocean drained away with my shrinking shadow,<br />
my pulse dwindled to forty<br />
I was sent to a place<br />
where girls didn&rsquo;t need poems to parade pain<br />
because it showed in the hollows of their eyes<br />
to a place where bones clattered into the cracks<br />
of floor boards on top of buried food crumbs.<br />
I stayed there day after day,<br />
but my mother would not come<br />
because she said I was vain<br />
and she was shamed by my vanity, my insanity<br />
and now I can only desire men who reject me<br />
who would abandon me<br />
in a sterile white hospital bed.</p>
<p class="thin">I&rsquo;ve aged and changed since then :)<br />
and will keep on aging and changing,<br />
learning and turning<br />
into a person who understands that<br />
beauty is about content<br />
not form.<br />
My professors taught me that poetry<br />
is about the blending of both, the bending and rending<br />
of the two to create new meaning in a poem,<br />
which is why when these old professors<br />
give me looks in their eyes<br />
that suggest desire not respect,<br />
ravenousness not intelligence,<br />
glamour not genius,<br />
that I&rsquo;m a token girl, not a token student<br />
that they&rsquo;re impressed with the elegance of my body<br />
not my body of work<br />
I suppress yelling<br />
I am not a poem you can analyze,<br />
whose stanzas you can dissect,<br />
whose words you can caress,<br />
a poem whose meaning is found<br />
where aesthetics and content collide.<br />
I am not a poem, but a person,<br />
who won a battle with vanity<br />
in a war to believe that beauty<br />
is about content<br />
not form<br />
who wants you to focus<br />
not on the the color of my lips<br />
but the color of my comments<br />
not on the weight of my body<br />
but the weight of my words.â–¼</p>
