<p><em><a href="http://theprettiotsmusic.com/">The Prettiots</a></em>&nbsp;are a band hailing from NYC and their sound is as sweet as their band name. With a cute '90s sound you'll find yourself bobbing your head and giggling along to the catchy and dreamy vibes. Fronting the Prettiots is Kay&nbsp;Kasparhauser, who states the girliest thing she does is "[play] in a girl band where I sing about boys and play ukulele."</p>
<p>The trio:&nbsp;lead singer Kay Goldberg, 23; drummer Rachel Trachtenburg, 20; and bassist Lulu Prat, 18; are fronted with a ukulele instead of a guitar. They're into fashion and their lyrics are so quirky and true to life you'll find yourself giggling along.</p>
<blockquote><p>All I ever wanted to do was make out with you<br />
Just hang out and order take out with you...</p>
<p>We don't have to fall in love,<br />
We can just make out and stuff<br />
Not that I want a one night stand,<br />
I'm actually totally not about that.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">Lyrics to '<a href="https://soundcloud.com/golightly-media/dreamboy-the-prettiots"><strong>Dream Boy</strong></a>'</p>
<p>This bright new band has just released a music video for their latest single <i>Boys (I dated in high school)</i>, painting a tongue in cheek view at Kay's previous romantic relationships, which Kay states are all 100% true.</p>

<p>There's something sweet and cute about The Prettiots, but they're more than cutesy tunes and pretty faces, with relatable music that will help any girl going through a break up, their straight talking and feminist prose are refreshing to see and fit for a Sofia Coppola film or an early John Hughes movie.</p>
