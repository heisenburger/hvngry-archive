excerpt: Here's a show that proves you can be hilariously funny and successful without
  being super problematic.

  content: "Firstly I wanted to say, YAY Hvngry is back! I've been reading for awhile
    and I thought you guys might be stopping but glad you're back! \r\nSecondly this
    was a good piece, I've never seen this show, but I'm definitely going to check
    it out now!\r\nThirdly though, I just wanted to ask about this 'nice guy scenario'.
    To be honest I'm pretty confused about the whole thing. Don't we want guys to
    be nice? Don't we want a boy to be considered a friend before we would trust them
    enough to sleep with them or enter into a relationship with them? Maybe I'm a
    bit of a hopeless romantic (took me a whole year to ask out my current girlfriend),
    but I really don't believe the friend zone exists, aren't there just good friends
    that we love without any sexual involvement?"

  content: "There is this idea out there (there often being the internet world) that
    'girls never go for nice guys' and these \"nice guys\" often complain that girls
    should date them because they will treat them right and they are always there
    for them.\r\nBut a girl does not OWE a guy a date because she cried on his shoulder,
    or he held a door open for her. If she doesn't want to date him this does not
    make her a *cringe* bitch. Because sometimes you kinda just know that you don't
    want to date a person. It is often these scorned men who claim to be in the mythical
    \"friend zone\".\r\n\r\nI think in that sense you are agreeing with the ideas
    presented in the article that these men should not expect anything but mutual
    friendship from the relationship. The idea of a nice guy is different from a person
    who is actually nice.....what did I just type?\r\n\r\nAnyway that is the situation
    as far as I know it, maybe Julia or Elsie have some thoughts on it?"

  content: Have any of you guys watched a show called Happy Endings? It's another
    show that I think defies character/race/sexuality stereotypes. Absolutely hilarious
    and I also think underrated.

  content: Happy Endings is one of my favourite TV shows of all time! I especially
    love the way it takes TV archetypes - the perpetually single lady, the dumb blonde,
    the uptight clean freak, the gay best friend - and turns them on their head in
    completely hilarious ways. Really enjoying seeing great discussion of television
    on HVNGRY - remember, "reading's stupid, TV rules!"

  content: "I totally agree that guys should be nice. I fact, I think that everyone
    should be nice. And it's great when friendships turn into romances, although I
    think there are lots of paths that can lead to positive romantic and/or sexual
    experiences.\r\n\r\nThe problem we were trying to talk about in this article is
    the idea (as Maddy said) of the 'nice guy', where men believe that they are entitled
    to sex/relationships because they are nice to women. Like, that women are vending
    machines where you put enough nice in and sex comes out. It's not a healthy way
    to build relationships, and it's pretty demeaning to women -- no matter how nice
    you are, you never 'deserve' sex for that niceness.\r\n\r\nI was definitely concerned
    that Brooklyn 99 was heading towards this idea: that Charles just had to be persistent
    enough and hand over enough 'nice' coins and Rosa would finally capitulate. I
    though it was great that Charles learnt that hasseling a woman sho wasn't into
    him is not a good way to act, and learned to value her friendship as a person
    rather than as a way to get into her pants."

<p>So, <i>How I Met Your Mother</i> just ended. It premiered almost a decade ago, and back then, we thought it was the Best Thing Ever. Looking at it now, it&rsquo;s more uncomfortable than anything else. Maybe it went on too long, maybe it was our burgeoning awareness of feminism and privilege, but really? Watching straight white characters smugly quip about how many sluts they bang? TV can do better than that.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it does do better than that. There&rsquo;s been an increasing number of fun, light comedies -- meeting the <i>How I Met Your Mother</i> need -- but without humour that relies on slut shaming and problematic stereotypes. <i>Parks and Recreation </i>&nbsp;is one. We&rsquo;re here to talk about <i>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</i>, which is another. Beware, there be spoilers ahead.</p>
<p><i>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</i> is a cop show, set in Brooklyn&rsquo;s fictional 99th precinct. It centres around the team who work there, an eclectic, strange, but deeply loveable group of people. One of the first things you notice is the diversity of the characters. The two commanding officers are black, the main detective is Jewish, two of the detectives are Latina, and four are white. Of the central characters, four are men and three are women. It&rsquo;s amazing how refreshing it is to see a group of characters who look like a normal workplace.</p>
<p>As with every comedy, <i>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</i> often gets its humour from characters acting as stereotypes: Charles is an over-the-top foodie; Rosa is super angry; Amy is uptight, straight-laced and ambitious; Gina is materialistic; and Jake is the typical wise-cracking maverick. However, they&rsquo;re also more nuanced and three-dimensional that most characters, and resist being reduced to these stereotypes.</p>
<p>As we get to know the characters, these superficial character types are undermined. Amy may be uptight, but she&rsquo;s also awkward, funny, and is never derided for her ambitiousness. Although Gina is materialistic, she departs from the vapid female character type when we discover that she is actually really thrify, financially smart, together, and is not without emotion or empathy.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<p>Although the <i>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</i> characters embody tropes, they aren&rsquo;t ones that come from their gender, ethnicity or sexual orientation. The black characters are totally remote from the &lsquo;angry black police officer&rsquo; stereotype. Rosa may be angry and aggressive, but she isn&rsquo;t defined as a bitch, not as a hormonal crazy-lady. The commanding officer, Captain Raymond Holt, is gay. Astoundingly for a mass appeal TV comedy, that fact neither defines his character, nor is it the source of his humour (which comes from his lack of visible emotion, a trait that flies in the face of TV&rsquo;s camp, overemotional gay male stereotype). Indeed, the only time in the series when it becomes an issue is when an old racist journalist tries to make it one, whereupon he gets punched by one of Holt&rsquo;s detectives. It&rsquo;s a wonderful moment.</p>
<p>The only potentially problematic bit of the show came in the relationship between Rosa and Charles. Although Rosa repeatedly told Charles that she wasn&rsquo;t interested in him romantically, he continually pesters her and tries to get her to date him. The series seemed to be playing out yet another Nice Guy scenario: Nice Guys (who are only interested in women for romance or sex, not platonic friendship, and believe they are owed affection for simply being a friend) get the girl eventually, just as long as they keep trying. Gross.</p>
<p>Miraculously, however, the series managed to not only avoid this, but to talk about why Mr Nice Guy isn&rsquo;t a good model for human relationships. The series makes it clear that Rosa doesn&rsquo;t owe Charles romance, even though he is a nice character, and that his obsession with her is not healthy. Charles finally realises this, and he apologises to Rosa for not taking her &lsquo;no&rsquo; seriously, and acknowledges that his behaviour must have been making her uncomfortable. They are able to move on, and forge a friendship based on actual liking, rather than creepy &lsquo;friend-zone&rsquo; friendship. When Charles gets over his obsession with Rosa, he finds romance elsewhere, in the deliciously realistic way of meeting someone at a party, having mutual interests, and then hooking up inside a cupboard.</p>
<p><i>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</i> premiered in September of last year, and has won two golden globes (best actor and best comedy/musical) and been renewed for a second season. It seems that viewers don&rsquo;t mind -- or indeed actively enjoy it --&nbsp;when comedy steps beyond the stereotypes and embraces diverse casts. Hopefully the success of <i>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</i> will encourage more productions to follow its model. If this is the future of TV, then we like it.</p>
