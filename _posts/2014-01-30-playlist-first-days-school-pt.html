<p>Summer holidays are ending and you're losing that feeling of freedom. Sleep-ins are starting to turn&nbsp; into early mornings; you can hear the birds again. It's bit sad but it's that beautiful kind of sad. Hope for the future and no matter how bad things are it will get better. This year is gonna be great :)</p>
<p>This is a mix of old and new, have a sing and a dance.</p>
