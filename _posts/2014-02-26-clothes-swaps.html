<p>Clothes are pricey as anything and it&rsquo;s the worst. While the op shop cycle is something I am all about, a nice variation is clothes swaps: not only do you get yourself some sweet threads on the cheap (often on the free), there&rsquo;s the benefit that you get clothes from a buddy and get to give clothes to a buddy. Buddies!</p>
<p>Make an event on your preferred social media and invite all your friends whose clothes you covet.</p>
<p>Some people are probably gonna be cool and bring refreshments but stock up on what you guys like. The last clothes swap I went to we had a tea party, but drink whatever you want.</p>

<p>Arranging by size can be helpful but sizes totally lie, so generally people just make &ldquo;give&rdquo; and &ldquo;take&rdquo; piles and everybody scratches through things themselves. If there aren&rsquo;t many people arriving at once, and they don&rsquo;t have a heap of clothes, a bit of a show and tell can help you find the flyest threads.</p>
<p>If people are really trying to get rid of things, they might sneakily leave them in your house and skedaddle, so make sure you&rsquo;re prepared to drop the dregs off at an op shop in a few days.</p>
<p>If you have something that was mad expensive, just let anyone that picks it up know that you&rsquo;ll be wanting cashmoneys for it. Basically everything else is generally free (it&rsquo;s a swap, right) so that&rsquo;s usually not too much of a hassle.</p>
<p>Be brave! Try on things you'd never try on in a shop. You're in a safe environment, and there's no pressure to take or not to take.</p>

<p>Remember that clothes swaps aren&rsquo;t just for clothes! Bring shoes, accessories, makeup. I&rsquo;ve even scored some sweet fairy lights and soaps from clothes swaps. One person&rsquo;s clutter is another person&rsquo;s treasured clutter.</p>
<p>This is usually a really body-positive experience too! You'll end up complimenting each other a lot. It's so lovely.</p>
<p>Start swapping and <em>have fun</em>!&nbsp;â–¼</p>
