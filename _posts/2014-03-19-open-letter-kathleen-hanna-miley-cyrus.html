  content: "I think you're taking her comment about \"do we want her in our club?\"
    way too seriously.  I think she meant it in a tongue in cheek way.  It's just
    a means of asking if she is really representing something positive for women and
    equality.  Not a great way to word, but I know what she meant.\r\n\r\nAlso, I
    don't see how Miley is \"appropriating twerk culture\".  She's a 20 year old girl...it's
    like PART of her culture and generation.  Just because she doesn't look like the
    people who coined the \"shake your ass like a stripper\" term, doesn't mean she's
    so removed from it.   She's just having fun with it and doesn't seem to be hurting
    or exploiting anyone by doing so."

  content: 'I''ve always taken cultural appropriation to be taking some symbolic part
    of another culture, then replicating it in a cheap and usually inaccurate way,
    and hence stripping it of its original meaning and context. The Miley case is
    difficult to discern -- on one hand it could be seen as appropriation of black
    culture, on the other we have to ask: why do we immediately associate this hyper-sexualised
    act with black culture? I personally have no grounding to comment on this matter,
    but there''s always <a href="http://thoughtcatalog.com/nico-lang/2013/08/cultural-appropriation-is-a-bigger-problem-than-miley-cyrus/"

    Mostly I just feel bad for her for having to collaborate with him, if at all,
    because that must've been a nightmare."

<blockquote><strong>Vice:</strong>Miley Cyrus recently called herself <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopmusic/10445850/Miley-Cyrus-Im-one-of-the-worlds-biggest-feminists.html">one of the biggest feminists in the world</a>. Is she?<br />
<strong>KL:</strong> I love that. I have no idea. What do you think?<br />
<strong>Vice:</strong> I don&rsquo;t know.<br />
<strong>KL:</strong> I don&rsquo;t know either. I mean, I feel like it&rsquo;s cool that she&rsquo;s this young girl that calls herself a feminist, but&hellip; do we want her in our club? [<i>Laughs</i>] Have you seen the new <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0CazRHB0so">Lily Allen video</a>? I&rsquo;d suggest you watch that.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">&ndash; Vice interview with <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/kathleen-hanna-talks-about-her-new-documentary-punk-singer">Kathleen Hanna</a></p>
<p>Dear Kathleen,</p>
<p>I love you and your music has helped me in more ways than you could ever know. That&rsquo;s why I was a little devastated at your response to whether Miley Cyrus was a feminist in your Vice interview; &ldquo;Do we want her in our club?&rdquo;&nbsp; At first I was shocked. How exclusionary! How myopic! Shouldn&rsquo;t we welcome any applicants to feminism&rsquo;s tiny group of supporters with a tray of freshly-baked cookies? Shouldn&rsquo;t you, as a fighter for equality embrace and redirect youthful energy and passion that may be misled?</p>
<p>Because I have some qualms with Miley&rsquo;s public persona as well. Her appropriation of &ldquo;twerk&rdquo; culture is cringeworthy, but may signal her growth in synthesizing genres. Her use of people as stage props is also clearly misinformed, but could be chalked up to a child-star complex, and could definitely be overcome with positive influences.&nbsp; Miley, as an 20-year-old woman, shouldn&rsquo;t be marketed toward tweens, but the young adults that understand the transformative time she&rsquo;s going through. I&rsquo;m sure you know all of this, but don&rsquo;t push Miley away, you have so much to teach her.</p>
<p>The Bangerz tour photos look crazy cool, you should check them out. She&rsquo;s definitely&nbsp; ushering in a new wave of iconography in music <i>a la</i> Madonna, employing pop culture symbolism and riding a giant descending hot dog. We live in a time of DVRs and archives, and Miley&rsquo;s brand of nostalgia-raunch understands this weird, confusing time in human history; celebrating it&nbsp; and capitalizing on it. The tour&rsquo;s art and animation was even conceptualized by John Kricfalusi, creator of <i>Ren and Stimpy. </i>Many people connect very viscerally with her persona, and she&rsquo;s skillfully crafted an aura of unpredictability, while acquiescing to certain trends.</p>
<p>Her new album shows a willingness to embrace a kaleidoscope of styles. Miley seems to be learning how to express herself right now, albeit very publicly. She&rsquo;s experimenting with scenarios, trying them on and twirling around in front of the mirror to see how they flatter her or don&rsquo;t. Every woman goes through stages of trial and error, it must be shitty to have every photo and sound byte uploaded. I&rsquo;m sure you wouldn&rsquo;t want people to judge you now on your actions in your 20s, either. But her vibrancy is undeniable, and her fearlessness and &ldquo;fuck your opinions&rdquo; attitude echo your Bikini Kill era. I think Miley has a riot grrl soul under all that pop-plumage.</p>
<p>Miley&rsquo;s claim to feminism is a choice for all humans, not just women. Her very willingness to embrace a dirty word like &ldquo;feminism&rdquo; should inspire pride as opposed to backlash. Maybe Miley&rsquo;s not the &ldquo;world&rsquo;s biggest feminist&rdquo; yet, but don&rsquo;t rule out the possibility or stymie her growth. Don&rsquo;t snub excited youthful bombast; guide, shape and love their energy and positive passion.</p>
<p>Miley&rsquo;s nothing new or shocking in the realm of pop, but she is harnessing the present like no one else. I&rsquo;m sure you didn&rsquo;t mean to sound exclusionary, I just want all her critics to take a bird&rsquo;s-eye view of the tornado to realize how beautiful chaos can truly be. Why not accept her brand of &ldquo;party feminism&rdquo;? Why not love and nurture her messy exuberance instead of tearing down the unfamiliar and guileless? I&rsquo;ve learned so much more about myself and my interactions with others since becoming interested in women&rsquo;s rights; I can&rsquo;t see how Miley wouldn&rsquo;t personally benefit from being exposed to more feminist, open-minded thinking. Kathleen, riot grrl has made me feel less blind in a world that&rsquo;s way too hard to understand; why deny that kind of blessing to Miley?</p>
<p>Your fan for life,<br />
