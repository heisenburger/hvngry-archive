<p>So I thought finding a job in Wellington would be easy. Feel free to scoff&nbsp;at my naivety at this point - its all downhill from here- "I'm an&nbsp;intelligent<sup>1</sup>, well-presented<sup>2</sup>, friendly<sup>3</sup> student, with free time on my&nbsp;hands. Who wouldn't want that?" is sort of what I assume I was thinking.</p>
<p>It turns out the answer was &nbsp;"Everybody". I was spurred on initially by the&nbsp;ads on Trademe that, somewhat suspiciously, didn't care about any lack of&nbsp;experience and promised a summer "outside in the sun" in Wellington, with a "great team of people". The thing that should have really ignited my&nbsp;suspicion, however, was the amount of exclamation marks in the&nbsp;advertisements. Two separate companies, who both saw fit, apparently&nbsp;independently, to put ads up with more than three exclamation marks next to&nbsp;each other should have made me question the sanity of the people working in&nbsp;sales.</p>
<p>Sadly it didn't.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, I was sitting upstairs in a flash office trying to sell&nbsp;the idea that I would be good at sales. Not to spoil the ending; but that&nbsp;was my first and only convincing sale.</p>
<p>A few days later, myself and 3 other girls - all with slightly desperate&nbsp;looks still showing through our best approximations of 'sales make-up' were&nbsp;inducted into the thrilling and dynamic world of being 'human commercials TM'.&nbsp;(As much as I wish I did, I didn't actually make this bit up.)</p>
<p>"It's face to face marketing! We approach people where they are&nbsp;comfortable- in their own homes- and provide them with the opportunity to&nbsp;receive a better deal on their product!! Who wouldn't want that?! Right?!&nbsp;Right guys?!"</p>
<p>I was forced to agree.<em> Obviously</em>, people would be surprised and grateful&nbsp;that the possibility to pay less on their power-bill had quite literally,&nbsp;come knocking. We'd probably be run off our feet making all the calls to&nbsp;confirm that yes, we have made <em>another</em> sale, and by the way, yes we would&nbsp;be going to after-work drinks.</p>
<p><sup>1</sup> Not yet failing<br />
<sup>2</sup> Sort of presentable<br />
<sup>3</sup> Not TOO socially awkward</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<p>My boss was a slick looking ex-poker player who was humiliatingly slightly&nbsp;younger than me, with a taste in suits that emphasized that he was also an&nbsp;ex-footballer with 'buns of steel'. (he had a sales move which basically&nbsp;involved turning his back on people which he claimed confused them and made&nbsp;them more likely to change power companies, but I'm pretty sure what it&nbsp;really did was dazzle old women with his glutes...)</p>
<p>We all had to practice sales in the morning in pairs. I sort of realized it&nbsp;was going wrong when I would get past the introduction and then find&nbsp;nothing else in my brain to say that wasn't either confused ('um, so I-we're looking for people who we can change, I mean sell , I mean... um, are&nbsp;you the person who pays the bills?') vaguely aggressive, ('we're looking&nbsp;for people who qualify, run and get me a power bill! Now!'), inane ('nice&nbsp;shoes') Or far too honest ('Hi. Yes, I do hate my job as much as it looks&nbsp;like I do. Please buy my stuff anyway. Also don't hurt me. )</p>
<p>After what may have been a few years, or possibly just half an hour, my&nbsp;boss was foolishly confident enough that we would be able to go out and do&nbsp;some sales with them. The first day we trailed over to Lower Hutt and drove&nbsp;round a confusing profusion of back streets which I realized with a sinking&nbsp;heart that I would never find my way out of by myself. I cursed myself for&nbsp;not leaving a trail of breadcrumbs or at least bringing my running shoes.</p>
<p>(I also spotted the dingy flat over a pet store where I once stayed the&nbsp;weekend and experienced my first ever bacon and eggs in an oven tray&nbsp;breakfast, on a shirt-dried plate, but that's a completely different tale&nbsp;of social awkwardness.)</p>
<p>My boss bounced enthusiastically out of the car and I tripped over myself&nbsp;and out onto the pavement in what I hoped merely looked like a paroxysm of&nbsp;extreme enthusiasm. For the rest of the day I trailed his bouncy,&nbsp;butt-shaping stride round Lower Hutt and knocked what I thought must have&nbsp;been all the doors in a 5 kilometre radius, but turned out to be just the&nbsp;doors of all the angriest people in a 5 kilometre radius. In an attempt to&nbsp;relieve the tediousness of standing behind him at every door with nothing&nbsp;more to do than try my best to NOT look like a serial killer (The more you&nbsp;think about it, the harder it seems to get) I asked if I could 'pitch' a&nbsp;few. He was delighted with what he perceived to be keenness to get to the&nbsp;customers and a 'good sales attitude' and let me do the talking. At least&nbsp;up 'til the point at which it became clear that while I could introduce&nbsp;myself, I was slightly worse at introducing the subject of cut price&nbsp;electricity. From there on it was all a bit of a steep, steep, blurry&nbsp;downhill.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<p>For a short while they were still all delusional that I might actually have&nbsp;some ability to sell things. This was based mainly on the fact that they&nbsp;hadn't actually raised the bar beyond requiring me to talk to people&nbsp;without running away or urinating on myself. Possibly at the same time.&nbsp;Around this time, to prove that they were serious, I was invited to a&nbsp;'pre-management meeting'. This mainly consisted of them explaining the power&nbsp;structure organization of the company. I kind of tuned out at this point,&nbsp;but from what I gathered, the aim was to spawn as many miniature sales&nbsp;companies as possible, employing hundreds of thousands of henchmen salespeople&nbsp;in a herculean effort to cover the globe with tiny (but dynamic!) minion&nbsp;sales teams so that no door would ever go un-knocked and evil would once&nbsp;again reign..... Or something along those lines.</p>
<p>"So." said my boss.<br />
"Pardon?" I replied. I was busy imaging the eventual sales apocalypse.<br />
"So." Clearly he wasn't listening, "if you look at the structure of ACME*,&nbsp;what does it look like to you?"<br />
"Uh. A pyramid?"<br />
"Exactly! But its not. It's really not a pyramid scheme."<br />
"Okay, why?"<br />
"I know it looks like a pyramid scheme, but it's not."<br />
"That doesn't really explain anything."<br />
"It's not a pyramid scheme, okay."</p>
<p>It was definitely a pyramid scheme.</p>
<p>Some time passed.&nbsp;Years possibly.&nbsp;For simplicity, I have included selected excerpts from my diary.</p>
<p>Day 3: Freezing cold. Doors knocked on: 80, rejections: 60. Fifty cent&nbsp;mixtures: 2. Sales: none.<br />
Day 5: Freezing cold. Number of jackets forgotten: 1. Rejections :73. Dog&nbsp;bites: 1. Sales: none.<br />
Day 6: Boiling hot. Sweat stained shirts: 1. Numbers of bus shelters&nbsp;hidden in to avoid work: 2. Sales: almost one.<br />
Day 8: Boiling hot. Number of times wished to faint in order to get a free&nbsp;ambulance ride back to Wellington: 3. Actual faints: zero. Number of people&nbsp;I have pissed off: At least 4. (On the plus side, dog bites: none) Sales: also none. Rejections: too many to count.</p>
<p>By this point, the only thing that kept me shuffling , zombie-like between&nbsp;people's houses was the tantalizing vision of walking into the boss's&nbsp;office, tearing off my sweaty grey shirt with its weirdly jaunty logo,&nbsp;tossing it on his desk and striding off majestically into the night. (Yes,&nbsp;with somewhat less clothes than socially and legally acceptable, but you&nbsp;can't put a price on my dignity, officer...)</p>
<p>*name not really changed that much at all</p>

<p>The real tragedy, one that continues to haunt me, is that I never managed.&nbsp;I was just composing a pithy quitting speech- something that contained the&nbsp;essence of "screw you" while somehow not actually saying those exact words -&nbsp;when I was called into the bosses office.</p>
<p>"So. It's the end of your 6 day evaluation-"<br />
"Was that really only 6 days?"<br />
"-um, yes. So anyway, how have you liked sales?"<br />
"It's kind of like a slow death, isn't it, really?"<br />
" ..right..."<br />
"Or being mauled by a pack of small dogs. Metaphorically, of course. But&nbsp;sometimes also literally."</p>
<p>There was a long silence.</p>
<p>He took a deep and somewhat pained breath.<br />
"Right, well it's this, and the fact that you haven't actually, um, made&nbsp;any sales that must make you realize that, well frankly, this isn't&nbsp;profitable for you, and it's not profitable for us either..."</p>
<p>I watched the opportunity for a dramatic quit scene whistle past my ears.</p>
<p>"Ah."<br />
"So. If you could just sign here... right where it says termination of&nbsp;contract... that's it, there..."</p>
<p>I signed.&nbsp;And in my head I strode off majestically into the night, unemployed but&nbsp;unbowed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
