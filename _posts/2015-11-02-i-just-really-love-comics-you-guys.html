<p>Trying to get my friends and family into comics has been a rough journey. Comics are my favourite&nbsp;medium, but I will be the first to admit that they don't have the best reputation. Comics is an incredibly&nbsp;diverse and experimental medium, but their public image is so dominated by one spandex-clad genre&nbsp;that it's sometimes hard to get past, particularly in the representation of women. Luckily, we're living in&nbsp;a new golden age of comics that star women, are written by women, drawn by women, and are&nbsp;aimed at women. Everyday the medium is changing, becoming more inclusive and diverse, and there are&nbsp;more and more amazing titles to recommend to the curious and dubious new reader. Here's a few.</p>
<h4>STRONG FEMALE PROTAGONIST</h4>
<p><em>Brendon Lee Mulligan (Writer), Molly Ostertag (Artist)</em></p>
<p><a href="/uploads/2015/09/sfp.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2488 size-large" src="/uploads/2015/09/sfp-700x1024.png" alt="sfp" width="700" height="1024" /></a></p>
<p>So, superheroes: fun as they are to watch and read about, aren't really equipped to tackle the real&nbsp;worlds ills, right? <em>"What are you going to do, Mega-Girl? Fling poverty into the sea? Smash us all into a&nbsp;better tomorrow?"</em> Mainstream comics do sometimes address this, and it's often cringe-worthy. But, the&nbsp;first rec on this list makes superhero ineffectiveness a central theme.<em> Strong Female Protagonist</em> is a&nbsp;smart, gorgeously drawn webcomic updating Tuesdays and Fridays, following the life of Alison Greene,&nbsp;aka Mega-Girl, formerly America's leading superheroine, physically invulnerable, and the strongest&nbsp;human being who has ever lived. She's also a twenty year old Uni student, who's desperately trying to&nbsp;find an identity for herself outside of heroics that defined her teenage years and to understand how she&nbsp;can more effectively help the world beyond punching people in the face.</p>
<p>The comic explores the ethics of superheroing and social justice issues in a world just as messed up as&nbsp;our own. This can make for a pretty somber reading experience sometimes &mdash; <em>SFP</em> doesn't shy away from&nbsp;explicitly addressing homophobia, racism, poverty and privilege. Still, all these issues are treated with&nbsp;sincerity and honesty, and you never feel as if the writer and artist are using them for cheap shock value.&nbsp;And for all the darkness inherent in the stories themes, <em>SFP</em> doesn't come across as nihilistic. It's a&nbsp;fundamentally hopeful story, about continued action in the face of injustice and the importance of&nbsp;cooperation over individualism in tackling complicated issues. After all, you can't just kick homophobia&nbsp;through dimensions all on your own.</p>
<p>You can find <em>SFP</em> <a href="http://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/">online</a>, where it is still ongoing, or find the first <a href="http://strongfemaleprotagonist.bigcartel.com/product/strong-female-protagonist-book-one">print volume</a>.</p>
<h4>MS MARVEL</h4>
<p><em>G. Willow Wilson (Writer), Adrian Alphona (Artist)</em></p>
<p><a href="/uploads/2015/09/msmarvel.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2489 aligncenter" src="/uploads/2015/09/msmarvel.jpg" alt="msmarvel" width="550" height="835" /></a></p>
<p><em>Ms Marvel</em> began early last year, after the former Ms Marvel, Carol Danvers, claimed the title of Captain&nbsp;Marvel (actually a step down, she was a full Colonel when she left the Air Force. Lady outranks Captain&nbsp;America.). Kamala Khan of New Jersey is the "average girl" of the Tumblr age: obsessed with&nbsp;superheroes, writing fanfic, and stifling under parents who just don't understand how important this gifset is. She's also developing bizarre superpowers after exposure to a plot device. Inspired by her&nbsp;favourite superhero Captain Marvel and her inherent desire to do good, she sets out to protect the&nbsp;youth of New Jersey from various supervillains. Ridiculous teenage shenanigans ensue, iconic characters&nbsp;guest-star (Wolverine thinks Kamala is awesome), and writer G. Willow Wilson manages to intelligently&nbsp;and sensitively tie Kamalas Muslim faith to her heroic identity and motives. Kamala isn't defined by her&nbsp;faith, but it is an important aspect of her character and her life that the comic treats with utmost&nbsp;respect.</p>
<p><em>Ms Marvel</em> is also a magnificent rebuttal to every "teenagers today are useless and lazy and will&nbsp;contribute nothing to the future" argument. Teenagers today are as varied and wonderful as the rest of&nbsp;the world, whatever out-of-touch baby boomers say. And let's be real, they didn't screw up the economy&nbsp;or fry the polar ice caps, but they are the ones who are going to have to live with it. I'll be honest, talking&nbsp;about Kamala and what a magnificent hero she is was about 98% of what motivated me to write this rec&nbsp;list. She's not Marvel's first female Muslim hero (X-Men has Dust and M, and Captain Britain has the&nbsp;delightful Dr Faiza Hussain, aka Excalibur), but is the first to headline her own ongoing title. <em>Ms Marvel</em> is&nbsp;about inspiration, hope, initiative and perseverance, doing what you can because it's RIGHT, to make a&nbsp;difference, even if it's hard, even if your parents don't like the giant space dog you just brought home.</p>

<h4>SUPER MUTANT MAGIC ACADEMY</h4>
<p><em>Jillian Tamaki (Writer and artist)</em></p>
<p><a href="/uploads/2015/09/smma.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-2490 aligncenter" src="/uploads/2015/09/smma-799x1024.jpg" alt="smma" width="799" height="1024" /></a></p>
<p>You know those long, aimless, vaguely philosophical conversations you have with your friends during&nbsp;lunch or after school? Where you contemplate your future, your present, your place in the world, and&nbsp;whether there is any real significance in any of it? You're not unique. Every high school student has&nbsp;those conversations, even students at a bizarre high school for vaguely defined magic and superpowers.&nbsp;<em>Super Mutant Magic Academy</em> is a collection of vignettes, short stories and one shot comics set in a high&nbsp;school that could be any high school. Yes, there are cute lizard girls and an immortal boy drifting through&nbsp;existence with blank faced ennui, but those aspects of the characters are secondary to their&nbsp;quintessential teenager-ness.</p>
<p><em>Super Mutant Magic Academy</em> is many things. It's a bizarre, irreverent, absurdist comedy. It's a parody of&nbsp;the literary tropes of school and fantasy stories. It's a visually striking work of art, rendered in loose,&nbsp;sketchy lines that resemble the margin-doodles you can find in any students textbook. It's a witty,&nbsp;incisive look at teen culture as it exists today. But most importantly, <em>Super Mutant Magic Academy</em> is a&nbsp;pitch perfect depiction of both teenage angst and teenage apathy, without passing judgement&nbsp;on either&nbsp;state of mind. In one comic, a character lies motionless on the ground. What's wrong?</p>
<p>"Everything."</p>
<p>"Nothing."</p>
<p>"I don't know."</p>
<h4>THE WICKED + THE DIVINE</h4>
<p><em>Keiron Gillen (Writer), Jamie McKelvie (Artist), Matt Wilson (Colourist)</em></p>
<p><a href="/uploads/2015/09/TWTD_1A.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-2492 aligncenter" src="/uploads/2015/09/TWTD_1A-662x1024.jpg" alt="TWTD_1A" width="662" height="1024" /></a></p>
<p>Keiron Gillen, Matt Wilson and Jamie McKelvie are one of my favourite collaborative comic creator&nbsp;teams, and their current ongoing <em>The Wicked + The Divine</em> is possibly their greatest work together yet.&nbsp;Every 90 years, a Pantheon of twelve gods from various mythologies are reincarnated as young people.&nbsp;They live. They inspire. They are loved, hated, and without exception, within two years, they are all&nbsp;dead. The comic follows the Recurrence of 2014 through the eyes of Laura, a teenage fan, who finds&nbsp;herself embroiled in a murder mystery among the gods she idolizes. The twist is that the Pantheon of&nbsp;the 21st century embody the symbols of worship and adulation of the times... which of course means that&nbsp;here and now, they are pop idols. Part of the experience, outside of the luminous art and writing, is in&nbsp;recognising how each god echoes real world musicians &mdash; Lucifer resembles a 80s-era Bowie, Amaterasu is&nbsp;more than a little Florence Welch, and Baal is Kanye, with all the ego and OTT of the real thing.</p>
<p>Celebrity is fleeting, and the lives of most of the main characters have a definite expiry date, which gives&nbsp;the series a sense of real immediacy as it questions ideas of fame, music and the power and meaning of&nbsp;both. The cast is wonderfully diverse as well, and the multitudes of women, queer characters and PoC in&nbsp;the story all have dimension and personality without having to fit into some imaginary diversity&nbsp;checklist. This is a series in which the literal incarnation of the Devil admits that transphobia is not okay.&nbsp;<em>WicDiv</em>, as it's fans affectionately call it, recently wrapped up its second story arc, with the series thus far&nbsp;collected in two trade Paperbacks. It's a great time to start.</p>
<h4>LUMBERJANES</h4>
<p><em>Noelle Stevenson, Grace Ellis, Shannon Watters (Writers), Brooke Allen (Artist)</em></p>
<p><a href="/uploads/2015/09/boombox_lumberjanes_001_a.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2494 aligncenter" src="/uploads/2015/09/boombox_lumberjanes_001_a.jpg" alt="boombox_lumberjanes_001_a" width="400" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>It's a sad theme in fiction that all women hate each other. All women are constantly in competition with&nbsp;each other, for whatever the plot demands. Women can't support each other, or celebrate each others&nbsp;successes, they're too busy despising each other. Sigh. Female friendships can be some of the most&nbsp;fantastic, enriching and supportive relationships there are, and it's horrible how often they are&nbsp;misrepresented. FEMALE FRIENDSHIPS ARE GREAT. And <em>Lumberjanes</em> is a beautiful, hilarious, all ages&nbsp;testament to this, with the creedo 'Friendship to the Max', and a magnificent array of female friendships&nbsp;at the core of the comic.</p>
<p>Set at a summer girl scout (not THE Girl Scouts) camp, <em>Lumberjanes</em> is a paranormal adventure in the vein&nbsp;of <em>Gravity Falls</em>, with a core cast of five friends who set out to unravel the mysteries of the surrounding&nbsp;woods... and get their merit badges for puns, make friendship bracelets, and goof off. I'm a Kiwi born and&nbsp;bred, so I can't speak for the summer camp experience, but I did attend an all girls school for five years,&nbsp;and the comic perfectly captures the camaraderie of girlhood and the friendships formed in&nbsp;adolescence. Lumberjanes also features several queer relationships, in both the main and supporting&nbsp;cast. The comic doesn't talk down to it's younger audience, and manages to deliver some simple,&nbsp;universal life lessons without ever being didactic or boring. This is a brilliant comic for young and old,&nbsp;and is a perfect entry point into comic reading.</p>
<p>I would go on, and I'd love to go on eternally, but I don't want to keep you here. Go read some comics.</p>
