<p>Fashion is a tricky thing to talk about. Everyone has an opinion about it,&nbsp;and everyone is involved with it whether he or she likes it or not. I think that&rsquo;s&nbsp;why I find it so fascinating. It&rsquo;s a projection of yourself. Even if you think you&nbsp;don&rsquo;t care about fashion you&rsquo;re simultaneously conveying to the world &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t&nbsp;care about what I put on my body each morning! I&rsquo;m laid back, I probably own a&nbsp;hand-me-down cat left behind by previous tenants, and I drink filter coffee.&rdquo; This&nbsp;is a total stereotype, but however much we want to disagree and break down&nbsp;stereotypical barriers, we subconsciously use these generalisations to navigate&nbsp;our way around a world filled with strangers. BOOM.</p>
<p>So getting dressed is stressful enough, the more awkward part is telling&nbsp;people that I want to work in the fashion industry. Say you work as a nurse,&nbsp;people aren&rsquo;t going to whip out a needle and say &lsquo;show me your skills&rsquo; but saying&nbsp;you want to work in fashion is basically like saying &lsquo;judge me&rsquo;. And then there is&nbsp;the equally stressful aspect of being &lsquo;in the know&rsquo;. I asked the editor at my&nbsp;internship if I could work on the fashion pages of our magazine, to which he&nbsp;replied, &ldquo;Oh you like fashion? Do you know &lsquo;Mr-fabulous-person&rsquo; and &lsquo;Mrs-&nbsp;fabulous-person&rsquo;?&rdquo; No, no I don&rsquo;t&hellip; but feel more than free to introduce me!</p>
<p>Even more awkwardly, I can&rsquo;t afford designer fashion. But the great part is&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t particularly mind. See, while I admire and respect people who have found&nbsp;success as fashion designers, I don&rsquo;t believe labels are the bible. Ok confession&nbsp;time girls, over half my wardrobe is from the op-shop, E-Bay, and (a little&nbsp;shamefully) K-Mart. But you could never tell, it&rsquo;s all about how you put things&nbsp;together! Now get ready for the cheesy part&hellip; in all 100% honestly, confidence&nbsp;and smile is undoubtedly the best accessory you can wear. We as human beings&nbsp;are 100% more likely to assess a person (and what they are wearing) when they&nbsp;look unsure of themselves or of a situation. Fake it till you make it!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I intentionally picked one of the most difficult industries to&nbsp;break into but hey, I like a challenge. And I love clothes. Getting dressed is like&nbsp;playing dress up: when I put together an outfit it influences my mood (smart,&nbsp;sophisticated, sexy) and even my productivity (I get waaay more done when I&rsquo;m&nbsp;wearing glasses and my hair is in a bun &ndash; it&rsquo;s science). My advice to other&nbsp;dreamers out there: like anything in life set goals, watch for opportunities and&nbsp;never let anyone slow you down. If you want to get to 10, aim for 12. If you&nbsp;unfortunately have to work for free to get to your goals then move back home,&nbsp;suck up your pride, and get shit done (not that I&rsquo;m talking about anyone in&nbsp;particular&hellip;). â–¼</p>
