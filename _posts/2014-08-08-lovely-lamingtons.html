<p>I love lamingtons. I really do. The jelly/chocolate outer layer, the soft sponge in the middle, the sweetness and dryness offset by fresh cream, and the final garnish of a dab of jam. Pretty perfect. Whenever I'm at a bakery, it will be a lamington that I choose.</p>
<p>Despite this, I'd never tried to make them: I'd assumed that they were difficult and time consuming, but I couldn't have been more wrong. Starting with a sponge cut into cubes, the creation process is closer to kindergarten finger painting than to careful cake decoration. The finished lamingtons look amazing and taste delicious&nbsp;&ndash; in an entirely different league to your usual supermarket offerings. They are richer, softer, far more flavourful, and are totally delightful. Piled onto a plate, and served with a cup of tea, these can't be beaten.</p>
<p>Here's the magic mix:</p>
<blockquote><p>1 sponge, 17 cm x 17 cm*<br />
&frac12; packet raspberry jelly<br />
&frac12; cup water<br />
1 cup icing sugar<br />
2 tablespoons of cocoa powder<br />
&frac14; cup milk<br />
&frac34; cup cream<br />
jam: raspberry or strawberry<br />
desiccated coconut<br />
<br/><br/><br />
<strong>1.</strong> Make the jelly, using half a jelly packet and half a cup of boiling water (this should be twice the strength indicated on the packet). Chill until cold and slightly thickened.<br />
<br/><br />
<strong>2.</strong> Make the chocolate icing by mixing cocoa powder and icing sugar, then slowly adding milk while mixing until smooth. Fill another bowl with coconut.<br />
<br/><br />
<strong>3.</strong> Cut the sponge into nine cubes, about 4cm per side. If the sponge has a thick crust, remove it, as it won't absorb as well.<br />
<br/><br />
<strong>4.</strong> Take each cube, dip each side into the jelly or chocolate mixture, then roll in coconut. Place on a wire rack and leave for half an hour.<br />
<br/><br />
<strong>5.</strong> Whip the cream, and slice each lamington diagonally from one corner to about halfway through. Fill with cream. This is easily done by pouring the whipped cream into a plastic bag, cutting a small hole in one corner, and piping it. Top each lamington with a dab of jam.</p>
<p>Eat the same day.</p></blockquote>
