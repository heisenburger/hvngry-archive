<p dir="ltr">This is a tip that has been used by many cultures across the globe for as long as anyone can remember. It is a trick that has been found in even some of the most remote tribes of Papua New Guinea and it&rsquo;s still being used today!</p>
<p dir="ltr">Follow these steps for this proven method and soon you&rsquo;ll be noticing people turning their heads for a second glance.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Start with a clean face: wash your face normally, pat dry with a towel and then moisturise (if moisturiser your your thing).</p>
<p>If you have long hair it is best to tie your hair back, we don&rsquo;t want it obscuring any of your face.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Now you&rsquo;ll need a mirror for this part, and good lighting. Stand or sit in front of the mirror. Good. Now while you&rsquo;re there take a look at that face. What a nice face that is. Just check that out! Aren&rsquo;t you lucky to have that representing you?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ok so here is the trick. You&rsquo;re gonna have to curve the sides of your lips up. Both of them towards your eyes. &nbsp;This may cause your cheeks to become fuller and your eyes to crinkle a bit but that means you&rsquo;re doing it right. Just smile. First smile like a stranger smiled at you in the street. Then, once you get comfortable with that, try exposing your teeth a little. Smile like the cute barista gave you extra marshmallows. Having mastered this all you have to do now is go all in. A big toothy grin that reaches your eyes. Smile like out of nowhere someone came up to you in the street and told you that you have a brilliant smile.</p>
