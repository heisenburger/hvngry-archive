  content: Great article - what a helpful and true conclusion you came to. I think
    we all need reminding of this these days! Especially with things like Facebook
    around making it so easy to compare your life to others. I read a quote on this
    somewhere that went something like "stop thinking your life is so boring - you're
    comparing other people's highlight reels to your day-to-day life".

<p dir="ltr"><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">When I saw the theme for this issue, I was a little hesitant in regards to whether or not I should write something about it.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">I&rsquo;m seventeen, a senior in high school, and I haven&rsquo;t had many firsts. I&rsquo;ve got a couple of the basics, like first time I smoked cigarettes (they scratched my throat and it was terrible), the first time I smoked weed (I drenched my shoes in a puddle and was called &lsquo;Boat&rsquo; for about a month after the story got around of my best friend jumping on my back and saying she was a seagull, and I was boat), first party (pretty lame) and first kiss (also lame and the only one I&rsquo;ve had).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Other than this, I don&rsquo;t have much to talk about, and even though I don&rsquo;t want to, whenever I think about this fact, I start asking questions about myself. Questions like &ldquo;What am I doing with my life? Why haven&rsquo;t I done more things?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Am I too annoying/brash/ugly to be desirable?&rdquo; Questions that, as a naturally self-confident person that knows her value can&rsquo;t be measured by a few crazy things she&rsquo;s done or how many people she&rsquo;s dated, I&rsquo;m not used to making.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After some thinking, I came to the comfortable conclusion that it&rsquo;s perfectly alright to not have many firsts.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are many answers I can think of to appease my fears. A reasonable one is that I simply haven&rsquo;t experienced all these firsts I keep hearing about on TV and movies, and reading on books and magazines (seriously, they&rsquo;re everywhere, as they should be, to guide and help the many people going through them, while confusing me and the rest of the inexperienced bunch). This answer, while reasonable like I said, doesn&rsquo;t really help me or other people in my situation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Because while it is quite probable that I&rsquo;ll, too, experience the things I hear and read about all the time, nobody can promise me this. I can believe it will happen, but I&rsquo;m also far too aware that it should have happened at some point by now and it hasn&rsquo;t to have blind faith in this.</p>
<p dir="ltr">And that&rsquo;s the most bittersweet part, if you think about it. How badly me and thousands of other people like me want all of this. I want to have sex and date and go on a roadtrip and party all night do all the crazy shit other people do (or so I hear they do), because if I don&rsquo;t, I feel like I&rsquo;m missing out on some big, life experience.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But I&rsquo;m not, am I? I&rsquo;m missing out on these things that, while great and memorable, are perfectly okay to miss out on as long as I keep enjoying life. I&rsquo;m doing plenty of other things that while no crazy firsts, are still fun, productive and helpful, and that&rsquo;s the answer I want and need to hear. Just last year I wrote a story that was over 70 thousand words long, and it&rsquo;s not a first I hear about often, but it&rsquo;s a damn good one.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I guess what I&rsquo;m trying to say is that I don&rsquo;t need to have many firsts as long as I&rsquo;m happy with myself. An experience only has as much value as we give it, and the best way to deal with all the firsts you haven&rsquo;t had but want to have, is to either go out and get them, or stop thinking about them as extremely important things.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Honestly, more often than not, firsts are kind of crap anyway.&nbsp;â–¼</p>
