<p>If you&rsquo;ve spend even a little time around the internet, you&rsquo;ve probably encountered Amy Poehler.&nbsp;Hosting the 2013 Golden Globes with Tina Fey; appearing as Regina George&rsquo;s mother in Mean Girls;&nbsp;working for years on Saturday Night Live; notorious for her Hillary Clinton impersonations. Since 2009,&nbsp;however, she has become best known as Leslie Knope, star of the comedy series Parks and Recreation. A&nbsp;small town bureaucrat with large ambitions, Knope presents a rare example of a female character with&nbsp;depth and complexity, who isn&rsquo;t afraid to be confident and follow her beliefs. When Amy Poehler&nbsp;published her first book, Yes Please, in October, I was both excited and vaguely nervous. Reading about&nbsp;the person behind a character you love is not always a rewarding experience. Leslie Knope has big shoes&nbsp;to fill, and I was concerned that Poehler would pale in comparison or end up disappointing, simply by&nbsp;not being Leslie.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have to worry. Yes Please captures the spirit of everything you liked in Parks and Rec: it is funny,&nbsp;feminist and honest. Poehler is at her best when writing about issues she cares about. She tackles&nbsp;subjects like motherhood, sleep, drugs, sex, technology, time travel, plastic surgery (told via haiku), and&nbsp;sexual harassment. Most of it is pretty great. Her ideas for divorce self-help books made me giggle out&nbsp;loud and her section on body-positivity should be handed out to every teenager. Readers will probably&nbsp;find parts they disagree with,; however, it would be hard not to love the way Poehler confidently wades&nbsp;in to very polarising debates and offers her opinion. It takes courage to call the debate between working&nbsp;and stay-at-home mums &ldquo;women-on-women crime&rdquo;, but Poehler does it, and argues her case well. And&nbsp;for Parks and Rec fans, Yes Please includes a few chapters about the show. You&rsquo;ll be pleased that know&nbsp;that Poehler and Rashida Jones (Ann Perkins) are actual friends in real life, that Nick Offerman (Ron&nbsp;Swanson) has two pet poodles, that Aubrey Plaza (April Ludgate) loves Judy Garland, and that Retta&nbsp;Sirleaff&rsquo;s (Donna Meagle&rsquo;s) aunt is president of Liberia.</p>
<p>My favourite part of Yes Please is the essay &ldquo;sorry, sorry, sorry&rdquo;. In it, Poehler writes about apologising:&nbsp;how women do it too often, how to enjoy righteous anger, but how to apologise for everything you&nbsp;should apologise for. With commendable honesty, she shares one apology that haunted her for years&nbsp;until she finally offered it. During a Saturday Night Live show, Poehler did a skit that involved a disabled&nbsp;doll. Although Poehler didn&rsquo;t know it at the time, the doll was based on two real twin sisters with&nbsp;cerebral palsy and their struggle to live a life of equal opportunities. Sisters who were watching Saturday&nbsp;Night Live that night.</p>
<p>Apologising is hard &ndash; it takes a lot of courage to admit when you stuff up. Reading Poehler&rsquo;s essay made&nbsp;me think about how, with the rise of the internet, situations like this will just become more common.&nbsp;Being intersectional can be really difficult, and it is easy to find that a joke you saw as innocuous is&nbsp;actually offensive. The internet allows people to encounter different perspectives and communities in a&nbsp;way that has never happened in the past, which means you are far more likely to be challenged, and&nbsp;told that something you did or said was hurtful.</p>
<p>The way in which Poehler eventually dealt with her mistake during Saturday Night Live, and the apology&nbsp;letter she sent to those concerned, I see as being a model for anyone who might find themselves in the&nbsp;same situation. Very importantly, she didn&rsquo;t try to dodge blame. She noted that although she hadn&rsquo;t&nbsp;known she was mocking a real person, that didn&rsquo;t really matter, as the sentiment was still the same, and&nbsp;it was her job to understand the context of what she was saying. She then wrote an apology, admitting&nbsp;she was at fault and was sorry. I hope that if I ever make a similar mistake, I&rsquo;ll have the courage to&nbsp;handle it like she did.</p>
<p>Although Yes Please is not perfect: there were aspects of the book design I didn&rsquo;t like, and some&nbsp;chapters were more interesting than others. Nevertheless, it is a delightful book. Yes Please captures the&nbsp;enthusiasm and energy that most of Poehler&rsquo;s characters project, and is funny, insightful and genuinely&nbsp;heartwarming. Several times through the book Poehler talks about writing another one. I can only say&nbsp;that I hope she does.</p>
