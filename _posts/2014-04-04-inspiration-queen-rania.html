<p>So there are a lot of royals in the world and generally I ignore them in the name of not helping out the class system (and anyone can be an inspiration, you don&rsquo;t have to be born into it like HRH or Avatar Korra) but okay I need to tell you about Queen Rania of Jordan.</p>
<p>While queens are often seen as relatively powerless heads of state, this isn&rsquo;t the case in Jordan. Queen Rania has an incredible focus on education and children&rsquo;s welfare at both local and global levels. She has founded schools, launched non-profit organisations (including a <a href="http://www.petra.gov.jo/Public_News/Nws_NewsDetails.aspx?Site_Id=1&amp;lang=2&amp;NewsID=138312&amp;CatID=13&amp;Type=Home&amp;GType=1">Children&rsquo;s Museum</a>!), written children&rsquo;s books, and taught classes.</p>
<p>She sees the importance of cross-cultural and interfaith dialogue, something that is particularly important in the Middle East &ndash; be honest, did you have to google where Jordan is? There are a huge number of stereotypes about Muslims and the Arab world which actively harm attempts for peace at a global and local level. Queen Rania is one of many people who are working towards dismantling these stereotypes.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s also completely behind the use of social media to assist in creating social change. She&rsquo;s on <a href="https://twitter.com/QueenRania">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/QueenRania">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/QueenRania?fref=ts">Facebook</a>, and <a href="http://instagram.com/queenrania">Instagram</a>. Her feed ranges from pictures of herself and her family to discussing the much more serious issues mentioned above. She's a confident, impassioned speaker in interviews and someone I dream of emulating one day.</p>
<p>Queen Rania knows girls can change the world.</p>
