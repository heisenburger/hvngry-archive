  content: "Nice article here , I especially like\r\n'By passing as straight, you&rsquo;re
    not betraying any queer underground.'\r\nI don't get the difference between queer
    people deciding they have a say in how you 'should' look or act , and heterosexy
    people deciding the same thing."

  content: "[&#8230;] that conflates a dress style with being queer, but this isn&rsquo;t
    necessarily true. As I said in a much earlier post, dress style has nothing to
    do with sexuality. This post is about the aesthetic of these ideals, [&#8230;]"

<p dir="ltr">First things first: whatever your sexuality is, you&rsquo;re fine. Even if you&rsquo;re not sure yet, that&rsquo;s totally okay and actually really common. Also, sexuality is fluid. You can be bisexual this year and 100% gay next year. That&rsquo;s all good. (Incidentally all this applies to gender, too.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Once you start identifying/thinking you&rsquo;re not heterosexy, you might start investigating what this whole &ldquo;not being straight&rdquo; deal is like. There&rsquo;s a whole bunch of bullshit out there. I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You don&rsquo;t have to wear plaid or get a sweet undercut or wear Doc Martens or get a nose piercing or become vegetarian to &ldquo;prove&rdquo; your sexuality. In a similar way, people that have a sweet undercut, nose piercing, and Doc Martens might look super gay, but you shouldn&rsquo;t really assume that until they give you their phone number with a wink (or until you give them your phone number in lipstick on a serviette and they blush a lot. Not that I&rsquo;ve ever&hellip;).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sure, some not-straight people do all those things. This is usually because they think Doc Martens are mad comfortable, not because of their sexuality. When you start identifying as queer, you don&rsquo;t get a pack including all the plaid you will ever need and a rainbow flag (unfortunately). You&rsquo;re exactly the same person, you&rsquo;re just using different words to define yourself.</p>
<p dir="ltr">By passing as straight, you&rsquo;re not betraying any queer underground. There&rsquo;s a lot of chat out there about how you totally are, but seriously, if the queer community can&rsquo;t handle you being true to yourself, they&rsquo;ve got bigger problems than you not getting the Right Kind of Haircut. ▼</p>
