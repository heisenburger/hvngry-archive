<p class="thin" style="text-align: right;"><em>Mirror: <br/> A surface capable of reflecting light to form an image of an object placed in front of it.</em></p>
<p class="thin">The mirror told me<br />
I looked great,<br />
even though<br />
my hair was wilted<br />
and dry, ready to catch,</p>
<p class="thin" style="text-align: right;"><em> Something that faithfully reflects or gives a true picture of something else.</em></p>
<p class="thin">and my ribs AS spokes,<br />
arms like wicks,<br />
waxen skin.<br />
I burned for kindling.</p>
<p class="thin" style="text-align: right;"><em>(A flat mirror causes distortion, </em></p>
<p class="thin">I listened<br />
when the mirror tells us<br />
to simmer down,<br />
slim down, torch<br />
calories, incense<br />
prayers to holy<br />
bony collarbones,<br />
frails wrists,<br />
thigh gaps.<br />
The mirror never reveals<br />
that imitation asphyxiates,<br />
consumes,<br />
ashes life away.</p>
<p class="thin" text-align="right;"><em>it produces a virtual or unreal image; </em></p>
<p class="thin">Full enlightenment<br />
took years.<br />
The process<br />
was slow, but<br />
gradually, I grew<br />
a tiny flame.</p>
<p class="thin" style="text-align: right;"><em>these images are unequal to the objects being reflected.) </em></p>
<p class="thin">I started to smolder.<br />
I curved out,<br />
sputtered desperately for change.<br />
But the mirror was smooth,<br />
reflecting and deflecting<br />
my hot accusations.</p>
<p class="thin" style="text-align: right;"><em>Something worthy of imitation.</em></p>
<p class="thin">How to feed the cinnamon flame?<br />
I smoked at the mirror and<br />
I blinked back,<br />
my eyes seemed dead and black and that&rsquo;s<br />
when the gasoline fear finally<br />
caught.<br />
I unleashed a flaming<br />
mane, body blazed<br />
a scream.<br />
I phoenixed through the mirror,</p>
<p class="thin" style="text-align: right;"><em>A mirror&rsquo;s reflective surface is viewed through a medium;</em></p>
<p class="thin">that tarnished silver,<br />
nothing more than a<br />
layer of thin</p>
<p class="thin" style="text-align: right;"><em>also called a looking</em></p>
<p class="thin">glass.</p>
