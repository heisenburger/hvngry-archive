A static version of [HVNGRY magazine](https://hvngrymag.com).

Created as we are retiring WordPress. Posts are imported through a script so please open an issue or message me if anything seems wrong.

## Spotted something?

If you see anything that's not quite right, please contact me and I'll try and fix it right away. Exporting the WordPress blog to Jekyll was mostly an automated process so some formatting may have been messed up.

Note that as of the most recent commit I have not yet linked the featured images of each post, that should be fixed in the next day or so.
