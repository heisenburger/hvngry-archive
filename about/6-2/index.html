<h3>6. Our Manifesto</h3>
<p>You know the feeling. The need of something more whilst flipping through magazine pages, plastered with size zero models and photoshopped actresses. The want to read and write about your interests, your passions, instead of aspiring to the unattainably narrow definition of &ldquo;beauty&rdquo;. That hunger that leaves you empty after neverending articles telling you to be smaller, quieter; &ldquo;how to look perfect for <em>him</em>&rdquo; -- like reality is good but never good enough.</p>
<p>Well guess what: we&rsquo;re not just good enough; we&rsquo;re better. HVNGRY is the antidote to a poisonous media landscape. HVNGRY is the breath of fresh air as we learn to truly celebrate ourselves and each other. HVNGRY is the inspiration that shows us what we&rsquo;re all capable of, and HVNGRY is the friendships that support and guide us along the way.</p>
