<h3>2. Our History</h3>
<p>The idea came one day as Serena found herself waiting in an upscale men&rsquo;s clothing shop, while her partner tried on expensive linens. Picking up a men&rsquo;s magazine, she flipped through, and in five minutes saw the reality behind hours of discussions about gender, power and prominence. In place of a gallimaufry of diets were how-tos in self-motivation. The gossip section about stars&rsquo; latest scandals were replaced by negotiation strategies for higher salaries. It was clear that gender equality, like repeats of Friends, was a modern fairy tale we point to as a comforting reality (but who really spends 10 years living in New York City interacting with zero people of colour?).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="A screenshot of a Facebook status lamenting the state of girls' magazines." src="/uploads/2014/01/THE-START-OF-EVERYTHING.png" width="533" height="185" /></p>
<p>The response was significant, but not surprising. Too long have we looked to media for inspiration, only to be met with limitations. It was then that Maddy, a fellow honours physics student; and Emily, a biochem / business major, got into talks about making this magazine a reality. An anonymous survey was created and sent out, and the response was everything from hilarious to inspirational to heartbreaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop eating or you&rsquo;ll get fat&rdquo;, answers a nameless 13-year-old when asked what she would tell her past self. &ldquo;I would tell myself not to be afraid to put myself out there,&rdquo; remarks a 14-year-old from New Plymouth. When asked to describe themselves, another 13-year-old spat out: &ldquo;Ugly and funny and cool and fat&rdquo;. Thirteen years of age and already media has affected our girls to the very bone of how they view themselves and their value as human beings.</p>
<p>They are not without dreams. Another 13-year-old looks to go to medical school to become a lab technician. Another 14-year-old aspires to study fashion at Parson&rsquo;s New School of Design in New York City. They want kids, a career; a full and happy life. Why do we underestimate them so? So often are teens girls reduced to the image of brainless, rampant fans screaming about the next Twilight movie -- they deserve a space where their voices are respected, their worries addressed and their aspirations fueled.</p>
