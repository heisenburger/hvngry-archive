 <p>First times, in all senses of the phrase, carry this strangely familiar feeling of anxiety and excitement, rolled up in a giant ball of&nbsp; "oh god I need to organise every tiny aspect of my life RIGHT NOW", and, "wait no I don't want to let's marathon all six seasons of <em>Gossip Girl</em> until I can't feel my brain anymore". It's scary. It doesn't go away. 'Real life' can get pretty terrifying.</p>
 <p>Except it isn't the 'real life' part, is it? It's not the thought of finding a job, nor the thought of putting my dream of being Jodie Foster in <em>Contact</em> on pause. It's not even the fact that I have no idea what to do with myself this month, let alone this year. I'm terrified because I am cursed with the knowledge that I sat in the City Finals for 48HOURS this year because ten years ago I decided to make a shitty film about drawing polka dots on the American flag. I am cursed with the knowledge that I graduated with a physics degree because at age 8 I picked up a book by Carl Sagan.</p>
 <p>I'm cursed with the knowledge of chaos theory, and am terrified that any decision will bar me forever from those other timelines that are brighter; more colourful.</p>

 <p>I'm not saying that your first times are going to be any more or less easy. But we should be reminded that no matter how daunting life seems at the moment, we have to remember one thing: we've all done this before. Not exactly this, but something very much like it. We've all dealt with the unimaginable dread that sinks to our stomachs as we realise that mum is, for real, walking away on our first day of kindergarten, and the tears and the fear take over. We've all dealt with life throwing us a curve ball, and we had to move to a new school, make new friends, meet new people. We've all hung in that place between going on and giving up when we've made a commitment to something we're not so sure about anymore. Uncertainty is a part of life. It's okay to not know.</p>
 <p>Sometimes, you just have to throw the die. Pick your guns, stick with it, and see what happens.</p>

 <p>Starting HVNGRY wasn't that much different. I had been thinking about starting a frank-yet-sensitive, no-bullshit magazine for a few years now. Last year I was flipping through a men's magazine, and was shocked at the difference. I posted a Facebook status. Nothing extraordinary.</p>

 <p>The response wasn't massive, but it got two people just interested enough. (Now this is where I get sappy.) But no seriously -- if it weren't for Maddy's passion and enthusiasm (and comments of "LET'S ACTUALLY DO THIS") and Emily's business know-how (and bubbly personality to combat my awkward silences), this entire project would've remained just another Facebook status.</p>
 <p>Credit must of course go out to our amazing authors and artists, who all worked pro bono, shared their insights and intelligence, and passion for this on-going project. We would literally have no content without you. (And on that note, you should <a title="Submit" href="https://hvngrymag.com/submit/">join us</a>!)</p>
 <p>To my friends, who listened to my feminist rants at parties (usually at 3am) -- thank you. For your earnestness and patience and terrible puns.</p>

 <p>Adding vintage clothing to your wardrobe is easy for several reasons. For one, vintage clothing is accessible and affordable: from boutiques to thrift stores, to your grandmother&rsquo;s closet, it is quite glorious how many great things you can find if you spare some time and use some initiative.</p>
-<p><a href="/uploads/2014/01/DSC0024.jpg"><img src="/uploads/2014/01/DSC0024.jpg" alt="Emporium clothes on the rack" width="100%" height="auto" /></a></p>
+<p><a href="/uploads/2014/01/DSC0024.jpg"><img src="/uploads/2014/01/DSC0024.jpg" alt="Emporium clothes on the rack" /></a></p>
 <p>Another bonus of going vintage is that it is tolerant and inclusive. Well, for the most part anyway. Sometimes you can get some weird size issues&nbsp;going on, but usually&nbsp;it&rsquo;s just a matter of trying everything (sometimes in the store) on until you find a piece that&rsquo;s the perfect fit for your body. Vintage clothing comes in a lot of different sizes and styles to suit you and your personality. I own vintage pieces that are really different, and love dressing to suit a particular mood or convey a particular style.</p>
 <p>One other great aspect of buying vintage garments is that&nbsp;you will probably be the only person in your neighbourhood/city/country/the world with that awesome dress/skirt/shirt/pair of shoes. Your vintage piece is exclusively yours. Not to mention that when you're buying vintage, you're essentially recycling materials, labour and shipping costs, meaning you're being a savvy, eco-friendly shopper. Kudos to you!</p>
 <p>To find some great&nbsp;vintage stuff, have a look around your neighbourhood for a boutique, peruse the local opshop, rifle through your parent/grandparent&rsquo;s &lsquo;old stuff&rsquo; or if all else fails, do what you always do and find it on the Internet. ▼</p>

 <p>The Internet told me that Valentines Day was coming up. The Internet also tells me where I can meet rich single men. Great. Cheers Facebook. As if I wasn&rsquo;t getting enough of that from my Indian fruit and vege man and my grandmother who reassures me that there are plenty of fish in the sea and that I will find a good husband one day. I still don&rsquo;t know why there isn&rsquo;t a facepalm emoticon yet.</p>
 <p>While as much as I dislike the cheesy, frilly and candy-coated fuss of it all I do really like the idea of giving handmade treats to your friends and loved ones just to say, &ldquo;hey, I think you&rsquo;re pretty great&rdquo;.</p>

 <p>I do love making people gifts and sending them as part of ridiculous care packages. The current recipient will be able to vouch for that. As soon as he receives the previous one in the mail I start conjuring up the next one in my head. These homemade shrewsberry biscuits are a practice run for next week&rsquo;s ordeal.</p>
 <p>When I was younger I was always a bit OCD about my shrewsberry biscuits, you know the Griffins ones. I had to always have equal numbers of heart punched ones as I did the triangles and circles. So biscuit consumption always had to happen in multiples of three. Here I am wondering why I was a chubby 12 year old . . .</p>

 <p>I found this recipe in the new <i>Little and Friday Celebrations </i>book by Kim Evans. The recipe calls for making your own raspberry filling but alas my freezer was not chocker block full of frozen raspberries. I used some good quality Anathoth jam instead.</p>

 <p>When making biscuits such as these, it is important that the dough is kept chilled and the raw circles are cool when they enter the oven. Ok, quick food science lesson:</p>
 <p>So when a biscuit containing butter is put in the oven, the butter melts causing the biscuit to spread outwards. When a biscuit contains egg (more important in this case, egg white) at a certain temperature the albumin proteins denature forming a gel. This stops the spreading of the biscuit. So in order to get a clear cut shape you need to balance these two reactions (<em>Ifreakinglovescience</em>). So by chilling the dough first you give the egg white a head start, so basically the outer surface will solidify before the butter has a chance to melt outwards.</p>

 <p>You can use whatever shaped cookie cutter you like. I went all mainstream and traditional and used my Mum&rsquo;s scone cutter to create the frilly circle. I hunted all around the kitchen to find something suitable for the centre punch until I remembered that the base of a piping tip would work just smashingly. Oh and it did. Sometimes the dough got stuck in it so all you have to do is blow on the other end to get it out.</p>

 <p>Happy Saturday Arvo, everyone! Today's vid is by the lovely Angelina, who talks about the notion of the "fake geek girl".</p>
 <p>A "fake geek girl" is a female fan (said to be conventionally attractive but, like other misogynist labels, can be applied to any female) who pretends to enjoy a particular facet of geek culture (comics, games, etc) for the attention of boys. While I'm sure that the amount of attention-seeking females is nonzero (and probably just as many as the number of attention-seeking males), the idea that just because a girl is both attractive&nbsp;<em>and</em> enjoys geek culture means that she's "faking it", is, clearly, ridonkulous.</p>
 <p>The only thing I have to add though, is this hilarious post that came across my dash on tumblr one day:</p>

 <p>Clothes are pricey as anything and it&rsquo;s the worst. While the op shop cycle is something I am all about, a nice variation is clothes swaps: not only do you get yourself some sweet threads on the cheap (often on the free), there&rsquo;s the benefit that you get clothes from a buddy and get to give clothes to a buddy. Buddies!</p>
 <p>Make an event on your preferred social media and invite all your friends whose clothes you covet.</p>
 <p>Some people are probably gonna be cool and bring refreshments but stock up on what you guys like. The last clothes swap I went to we had a tea party, but drink whatever you want.</p>

 <p>Arranging by size can be helpful but sizes totally lie, so generally people just make &ldquo;give&rdquo; and &ldquo;take&rdquo; piles and everybody scratches through things themselves. If there aren&rsquo;t many people arriving at once, and they don&rsquo;t have a heap of clothes, a bit of a show and tell can help you find the flyest threads.</p>
 <p>If people are really trying to get rid of things, they might sneakily leave them in your house and skedaddle, so make sure you&rsquo;re prepared to drop the dregs off at an op shop in a few days.</p>
 <p>If you have something that was mad expensive, just let anyone that picks it up know that you&rsquo;ll be wanting cashmoneys for it. Basically everything else is generally free (it&rsquo;s a swap, right) so that&rsquo;s usually not too much of a hassle.</p>
 <p>Be brave! Try on things you'd never try on in a shop. You're in a safe environment, and there's no pressure to take or not to take.</p>

 <p>Remember that clothes swaps aren&rsquo;t just for clothes! Bring shoes, accessories, makeup. I&rsquo;ve even scored some sweet fairy lights and soaps from clothes swaps. One person&rsquo;s clutter is another person&rsquo;s treasured clutter.</p>
 <p>This is usually a really body-positive experience too! You'll end up complimenting each other a lot. It's so lovely.</p>
 <p>Start swapping and <em>have fun</em>!&nbsp;▼</p>

 <p>In that vein, we&rsquo;ve got to start with Lorde. This girl needs no introduction. If you haven&rsquo;t done so already, I recommend that you acquire her debut album <i>Pure Heroine</i>. Some of the songs that are not yet singles (and may never be) are absolute gold. One of my favourites is <i>Ribs</i>. Also popular among my friends are <i>Buzzcut Season</i> and <i>White Teeth Teens</i>.</p>
 <p>Starting with Lorde offers a neat segue to Watercolours and Doprah. Both acts opened for her recent Auckland concert.</p>
 <p>Watercolours is Chelsea Jade Metcalf, an Auckland girl who makes dreamy tunes perfect for tucking up inside with a good book on a rainy day. Check out her EP, <i>Portals</i>:</p>

 <p>Doprah is Stephen John Marr and Indira Force, who hail from Christchurch. Not quite a girl group but they&rsquo;re so great they deserve to be here. And Indi is a total babe &ndash; she&rsquo;s a tour de force on stage. Not much of their stuff is online, which is a bit of a shame, but have a listen to <i>San Pedro</i> and keep an eye out for them playing around New Zealand.</p>

 <p>To go international now, Santigold makes soul-hip hop-dance music that forms a core part of my running playlist. You&rsquo;ll see what I mean if you have a listen to <i>Look at these hoes</i>, a tune off sophomore album <i>Master of my Make Believe</i>.</p>

 <p>Santigold has often been compared to another great female artist, MIA. If you haven&rsquo;t come across MIA before you&rsquo;re missing out. Her video to single <i>Bad Girls</i> is essentially a great big fuck-you to the Saudi laws against women driving. It&rsquo;s off the album <i>Matangi</i>, an album that is a more challenging listen than your average pop music.</p>

 <p>And then there&rsquo;s Janelle Monae, R&amp;B and soul musician. Her latest album <i>Electric Lady</i> takes the form of a radio show on a droid station, in a reality where androids and humans live not quite peaceably side by side. <i>Q.U.E.E.N</i>, feat Erykah Badu, gives you an idea of that concept;</p>

Fill a piping bag with a large round tip with the chocolate custard. Stick the tip of the nozzle into the hole of each doughnut and squeeze to fill until the custard pushes back and starts to come back out the top a wee bit.</p>

 <p>That feeling of scary change creeps up on you though, when you're just staring out the window having lunch, or browsing the news, and suddenly you realise that the world -- the entire world -- is <em>happening</em>. <em>Right now</em>, all around us. I kind of wish I had the power to reach into the Matrix somehow and just yell, "SLOOOW TIIIMME". But alas. I am not Neo.</p>
 <p>So, why "changes" for this month's theme? I feel like a lot of us are going through changes in our lives -- and to be honest, in this day and age (ahem, <em>the future</em>) and with our generation (<em>the future</em>), how could we not? <em>"Everything happens so much,"</em> I feel continuously out of sync with the world, always trying to catch up, like I'm in some kind of dream quicksand where you're trying to run faster but you just. Can. Not.</p>
 <p>I feel like this is the right place to post <a href="https://twitter.com/shashashasha">Sha</a>'s Webstock talk about technology and the future, but it's not uploaded yet :-( Check back in a few days -- I'll embed it here as soon as it's up. For now, here's a song that embodies my current feels:</p>

 <p>I really don't know where I'm going with this&nbsp; -- and I'm writing this on a lunch break at McDonald's so, perhaps I'm not in the right mindspace for insightful thoughts and clever ideas -- but perhaps what we really need right now is not insightful dialogue. Perhaps what we need is just some space, some quietness; just the constant hum of friends, whispering their own stories in the background, even if only as proof that you are not alone in this. And I'm always a big advocate for making time for yourself; indulging in distractions and "time-wasters," if that's what you need to clear your head. So. Let's do some random story sharing. I'm going to tell you about a super cool Thing I went to this weekend called Rails Girls.</p>
 <p><!--nextpage--></p>
 <p><a href="http://railsgirls.com/wellington">Rails Girls</a> is a programming workshop that runs for two full-on days, where anyone can apply and learn how to code with Ruby on Rails. There's an awesome mix of people -- everything from a 10 year old girl (who was a whizz, btw), to a highly experienced .NET programmer who, let's face it, probably knew more about programming than half of the coaches there. (Quick FYI: Ruby is a programming language and Rails is a framework which you can use to code up web apps super super easy.) There was much programming, learning, cupcakes and selfies. [Trigger warning: my face]</p>

 <p>IT WAS SO FUN YOU GUYS. The Ruby community is the most wonderful collection of super awesome, super supportive people who are always happy to help when you've got a silly, silly question. If you've ever wanted to get into programming, Ruby on Rails is a great way to start. Even if you can't get yourself to one of the workshops, the <a href="http://guides.railsgirls.com/">guides</a> are super straight forward and you can just work through them whenevs. And if you ever have questions, <a href="http://twitter.com/sereeena">hit me up</a>.</p>
 <p>I'm probably not the most well-versed person to comment about this, but I'm sure we all know about the lack of lovely ladies in the programming and tech communities. Note that I said <em>communities</em> specifically -- it's not a problem that girls aren't interested in programming, but that the communities themselves are super intimidating and usually rife with bro-culture (See: the recent <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/19/5526574/github-sexism-scandal-julie-ann-horvath">GitHub clusterfuck</a>).&nbsp; That's why things like Rails Girls are so awesome and important -- it's a safe space to do code.</p>
 <p><em>FUN FACT: Ladies were actually the <a href="http://gender.stanford.edu/news/2011/researcher-reveals-how-%E2%80%9Ccomputer-geeks%E2%80%9D-replaced-%E2%80%9Ccomputergirls%E2%80%9D">first programmers</a>! Check out Maddy's <a title="Lady of Science: Ada Lovelace" href="https://hvngrymag.com/2014/01/24/lady-of-science-ada-lovelace/">awesome article</a> on Ada Lovelace; there's a bunch of other cool links in that article too if you wanna read more.</em></p>
 <p>What do we take away from this haphazardly-crafted letter? I dunno. Life happens so much, so if you ever need a place to vent, or to escape, we're here for ya.</p>

Queen Rania is one of many people who are working towards dismantling these stereotypes.</p>

 <p>Catchy pastel pop music can sometimes be distracting and Meghan Tainor&rsquo;s &ldquo;All About That Bass&rdquo; is no different. At first it&rsquo;s a fabulous body positive song; but at a closer listen it seems to just be further policing women's bodies. She&rsquo;s not the only one that has &ldquo;the junk in the right places,&rdquo; and that her mumma said &ldquo;boys like a little more booty to hold at night&rdquo;. Another example is in Nicki Minaj&rsquo;s &ldquo;Anaconda&rdquo;, which claims &ldquo;he don&rsquo;t like them bony&rdquo;. Not only is this just another tirade about how women 'should' look, but also insinuates that how we look should be directly in line with how men want us to look. I am all for body pride, but as&nbsp;a size 10 with no &ldquo;booty&rdquo;, I don&rsquo;t find this empowering.</p>

 <p>Understandably, girls who are bigger get a lot more stick. We see constant images in the media of skinny being&nbsp;better. Clothing stores don't often make garments that accommodate larger sizes. There are real injustices that larger women face, but we have to be careful not to turn body positivity into further shaming and control. Especially when messages of body positivity become mixed with the idea that girls should care what boys like.</p>

 <p>Trainor raises some good points: &ldquo;you are perfect from head to toe&rdquo;. But I don&rsquo;t see anything wrong with being a stick-thin barbie doll too, if that&rsquo;s your thing. I am proud of the size I am, and just because I don&rsquo;t have the booty to go with the songs I&rsquo;m shaking it to, doesn&rsquo;t mean I'm not allowed to.</p>
 <p>I think we should take a step back and remember what it's really about. We currently live in a world obsessed by the wants of men. A world where women's bodies are not ours, but displays to please others. By further perpetuating that certain body shapes are better than others because men prefer them, we are perpetrating these toxic ideas further. Whether it's a man or a woman doing this policing is no different.</p>
 <p>While both songs are catchy and are encouraging the fact that girls with booties are beautiful, I think we have to be careful not to shame any shape. Take a page out of Beyonc&eacute;&rsquo;s book and remind yourself everyday that regardless of size, shape, sexual preference or culture, you are flawless.▼</p>

 <p>Back to Africa now. It took time for the Chimpanzees to acclimatise to her presence in the park. They would mostly keep there distance but she persevered. She watch and she watched and she made notes in her book and then one day she observed something of great interest. Two chimps she had dubbed&nbsp;David Greybeard and Goliath were using sticks as tools to extract termites from their nest. Before that it was believed humans were the only animals to use tools. Louis Leakey said of the matter,</p>
 <h4><span style="color: #150f24;">"Now we must redefine tool, redefine Man, or accept chimpanzees as humans."</span></h4>
 <p>In 1962,&nbsp;Leakey decided with all this important research she had been doing she may as well obtain an official record of it so he sent her to obtain a Ph.D in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethology">Ethology</a>&nbsp;from Cambridge University. She was one of very few people to be accepted as a doctoral candidate with no previous bachelors degree. Her research had been critisied by others in the field at the time. One reason was because she gave the chimps names instead of more scientific numbers. But what Jane realised was that chimpanzees were more like humans than anyone had thought. She even had the audacity to say that they had personalities and this really ruffled some feathers.&nbsp;In 1966&nbsp;she obtained her Ph.D.</p>

 <p><strong>Soft Masc</strong></p>
 <p>This is taking traditionally &ldquo;feminine&rdquo; elements and using them to accent &ldquo;masculine&rdquo; things. Think plaiting flowers into your beard, flower-patterned doc martens, <a href="http://www.stylebeans.com/fresh-beans-new-arrivals/pastel-plaid-shirt/">pastel plaid</a>.

 <p>The idea of taking something &ldquo;masculine&rdquo; and making it gentle isn&rsquo;t really a new thing, but I am happily pleased with how mainstream it is becoming. Some days you want to look manly, and that shouldn't disrupt your colour or pattern range. Some days, guys just want <a href="http://www.thebolditalic.com/articles/3547-guys-with-fancy-lady-hair">Fancy Lady Hair</a>. Soft Masc makes this easier. (also, while all my pictures are of men, Soft Masc isn't limited to men - you too can be Soft Masc. Rock your Serious Androgynous Clothes with your pastels and your patterns. Do it.)</p>

 <p><strong>Hard Femme</strong></p>
 <p>Hard femme is a less recent trend, although not being super old I can&rsquo;t say for certain when it started. At the core, it&rsquo;s being feminine and tough. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wDo2MOCLTk">Lipstick and cleats</a>, 50s-style dresses with spiked jackets and shoes, hot pink doc martens (or faux-doc martens) &ndash; it&rsquo;s the art of pairing things that wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily go together if you were just going for a feminine look or for something more punk, or finding items that are kind of both (<a href="http://blackmilkclothing.com/">Black Milk</a> can do this quite well).</p>

 <p>Wonder Woman was probably hard femme, now I think about it.&nbsp;A chest plate, cuffs that can stop bullets, battling the forces of evil, paired with a form-fitting bodysuit and deadly diadem make you pretty hard femme.</p>
 <p>The term &ldquo;hard femme&rdquo; is often used in a sense that conflates a dress style with being queer, but this isn&rsquo;t necessarily true. As I said in a <a title="Queerchat" href="https://hvngrymag.com/2014/01/24/queerchat/">much earlier post</a>, dress style has nothing to do with sexuality. This post is about the aesthetic of these ideals, not anything else!</p>
 <p>You can rock whatever style you like, and if being more like Wonder Woman is your jam, try hard femme.▼</p>

 <p>Earlier this year Sophia and I had a <a title="Roundtable: On Selfie Culture" href="https://hvngrymag.com/2014/02/05/roundtable-selfie-culture/">great chat about selfie culture </a>and how it promotes self love and acceptance. It's so fitting with this theme -- the different ways in which we express pride in a public medium (whether it be selfies or what-have-you) do two super important things. First, it teaches us to be okay with ourselves: what we look like, our personality, etc. After a while of practicing this it teaches us to start genuinely liking ourselves, which is so important in a generation riddled with depression. Secondly, it takes the power of representation back into our hands.</p>
 <p>So take it. It can be very easy to feel powerless, but media has never been more democratic. You have the power to show the world who you (a real human being) are. You have the power to show the world all the ways in which you are unapologetically great. You have the power to support your friends for standing being prideful in themselves. And you have the power to post as many selfies, pictures of your food, statuses about how you got out of bed and put on pants today, obnoxious lyrics to your favorite song, badly spelt posts about your feelings -- whatever you want.</p>
 <p>Own the space around you. Be prideful. Be vain. Don't apologize. You're doing great. I'm proud of you.</p>

 <p>A few weeks ago we received a seriously quality video in our submission box -- Made by the talented Marina Mersi and Jess Dellabarca. They survey various high school students, as well as various organisations around New Zealand about their thoughts on consent.</p>

+<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Iz8nYbHaty8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
 <p>What's so fantastic and ground-breaking to me about this video is that throughout my education, I and my peers have never been taught about the idea of consent. Health class was when condoms were put on bananas, "STDs are bad", and a LOT of reading from <em>Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul</em>. The idea that sexual consent is something that is enthusiastically and continually given was never even touched on.</p>
 <p>The then-academic-now-buzzworded concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_culture">rape culture</a> is extremely hard to address -- especially within New Zealand's laid-back, 'she'll be right' lifestyle. But if there's anywhere to address it, sex education in schools is the ideal place to start. Especially because it will most likely be preventative, and teen brains are so much more well equipped to question the society around us. As adults, we become so entrenched in the culture we grew up with that it makes it very hard for us to question anything without years and years of bias.</p>
 <p>We don't know who submitted this video to us, but to them and Marina and Jess: we request the highest of fives. I hope high schools all around the world can too have these extremely important conversations, and I'm so happy that these conversations are happening.▼</p>

 <p>Never put yourself in danger to perform CPR. Minimise threats.&nbsp;For example, if a person is lying on a road, check that traffic is blocked. If they have been electrocuted, be sure the source is no longer powered. You're doing nobody any favours if you end up hurt and needing help, too.</p>

 <p>If there are others around, get one of them to call an ambulance (111 in New Zealand). If you're alone, call them yourselves. Tell them where you are, and tell them you're going to perform CPR. In most cases, the dispatcher on the phone will be trained to help talk you through this.</p>

 <p>Putting text on a stencil is really easy - Just type it up in word in the size and font you want, and print it off!</p>
 <p>Otherwise, draw your design straight on.</p>
 <h5>2. Fusing the stencil</h5>

 <p>Chop a bit of the black rubbish sack so it&rsquo;s the same size as your piece of paper</p>
 <p>Put the paper over top of the piece of rubbish sack. Put your iron on middle heat, and iron on top of the paper (not letting the iron come into direct contact with the plastic); this should fuse the paper and plastic together. If it&rsquo;s not working, turn the iron up slowly and keep trying.</p>
 <p>Once the backing has fused and shrunk a bit, trim the edges so the paper and plastic are flush, and you can therefore iron right over the edges to get a decent fusion.</p>
 <p>As the paper and plastic fuse with the heat, the paper might crinkle and curl a bit - this is fine; you&rsquo;ll straighten it up later on.</p>
 <p>After you&rsquo;ve fused the paper and plastic together, turn it over and check for holes. It&rsquo;s normal for little holes to form in the plastic; just chop off more rubbish bag, lay it over the hole, and iron again (from the paper side) until your holes are covered.</p>

 <p>With your craft knife, cut out the stencil, going through both the paper and the plastic layers.</p>
 <p>If you have 'floaty' bits, such as the holes in the middle of letters (for me, the inside of my 'R'), that's cool, save those parts and remember where they go.</p>
 <h5>4. Ironing on your Stencil</h5>

 <p>Now your stencil is ready to fuse onto your fabric. Place it where you want it, and slowly iron over it. The iron will probably need to be a little hotter than it was for fusing the paper and plastic.</p>
 <p>Any of those floaty bits you had, lay them in place once you've fused on the main stencil, then iron them on too. Your stencil is ready for painting when none of the edges want to come away from the fabric. Sometimes this takes a lot of heat.</p>

 <p>It's been a tumultuous first half of 2015. There's been ups and downs all over the world &mdash; I hope you've had a little more of the former!</p>

 <p>This picture, called "earthrise", was taken on the first manned mission to the moon: Apollo 8. This was one of the first photos that really put us, all of us, into perspective. To loosely quote my childhood hero Carl Sagan: everything we've ever known, everywhere we've ever gone, and everyone we've ever loved, is on that tiny blue dot, floating in space. To think, throughout history, so many people have worked so hard, hurt so many, just to gain control of a fraction of a fraction of a dot. Astronaut Ed Mitchell remarked:</p>
 <blockquote><p>&ldquo;From out there, international politics looks so petty. You want to grab them, drag them a quarter of a million miles out, and say, 'Look at that, you son of a bitch'.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
 <p>It also reminds us, that outside of the people on this planet, we have no one but each other. From out there, it reminds us how vast our similarities; how minuscule our differences. And yet, so much of our world is built focusing on our differences. From birth until forever we are given labels to separate us in all the arbitrary ways that society can: gender, race, sexuality, religion; blah blah blah.</p>

 <p>Y'know what I found helped profoundly? Simply&nbsp;stepping away from the computer. Have dinner with the people you live with. Go out with your friends. This sounds clich&eacute; as fuck but it is so important. Have face-to-face conversations. You'd be amazed at how well your "I'm being an asshole" detector works in person. And if you're feeling up to it, dare to talk about touchy topics with a good friend whom you respect. Notice how much more you feel where they're coming from.

 <p>The beetroot gives this soup a rich earthy flavour and the kumara sweetens it right up and enhances the beety flavour. I sprinkle over feta to add a salty and a creamy aspect.

 <p>Imagine you set off a Big Bang. Imagine you set off <em>many</em> Big Bangs. Newborn universes are all small, grubby and just a little disorganised. But you love them, and want each of them to grow into a well-balanced cosmos with an even spread of stars and galaxies, and an almost (but not quite!) smooth <a href="http://excursionset.com/blog/2013/3/21/the-microwave-background-how-two-guys-working-for-the-telephone-company-discovered-the-origin-of-the-universe">microwave background</a>. What should you do?</p>
 <p>Most cosmologists would suggest a dose of <em>inflation</em>, delivered at an early age. During inflation, your baby universe grows very&nbsp;rapidly, making sure that the grown-up universe is smooth and flat. It's like stretching out a wrinkly cloth - the more you stretch, the flatter it gets. This dramatic expansion not only smoothes away any irregular leftovers of the Big Bang, it also generates the starting ripples that eventually grow into galaxies. Places that were once almost touching now find themselves on opposite sides of the sky. The microwave background (the echo from the Big Bang we can still see today) is almost identical in every direction.</p>

 <p>During inflation, the universe expands dramatically, diluting any leftovers of the Big Bang itself.</p>
 <p>Cosmologists don't give tips to newbie universe-builders, but we do ask how our universe evolved. It was quickly discovered that a simple Big Bang needed very&nbsp;special starting conditions to grow into the universe we live in now. This is a problem for cosmology, because you then need to ask why the early universe found itself in the very special configuration that let it grow up to look the way it does today. But In 1980, physicist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Guth">Alan Guth</a> realised that a thing he called <em>inflation</em> made these "initial conditions problems" manageable, even if it didn't solve them completely. Inflation rapidly became part of the theorists' tool kit to make these problems easier.</p>
 <p>What does inflation look like? In a smooth, expanding universe the distance between any two places gets bigger. But <em>inflation</em> makes sure that the speed at which they fly apart <em>keeps going up</em>. It is the empty space between galaxies that expands; "bound" objects, like atoms, solar systems, galaxies, people, kittens, etc, don't expand.</p>
 <p>The key ingredient of inflation turns out to be <strong>negative pressure</strong>, which might sound weird, but it's not. You know what positive pressure looks like: stuff that expands, releasing energy that can be turned into motion. Like a shaken up bottle of ginger beer, or this bike pump powered water rocket:</p>
-<p><center><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/89176128" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>Just as stuff with positive pressure wants to <em>expand</em>, stuff with negative pressure wants to <em>contract</em> &mdash; like a stretched rubber band that goes "ping". See, you knew what negative pressure was all along.</p>
+<p><center><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/89176128" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>Just as stuff with positive pressure wants to <em>expand</em>, stuff with negative pressure wants to <em>contract</em> &mdash; like a stretched rubber band that goes "ping". See, you knew what negative pressure was all along.</p>
 <p>So negative pressure may not be mysterious, but is it something that makes a universe <em>expand</em>? Surely you'd want positive pressure for that?</p>
 <p>Um. Yes. Well, sort of. If the universe is pushed apart by the stuff inside it, the pressure drops as space expands. And if pressure helps universe expand, expansion slows as the universe gets bigger and the pressure gets smaller. But inflation is <em>accelerated</em> expansion, so paradoxically needs <em>negative</em> pressure. Bear with me here.</p>
 <p>The next apparent paradox is the <em>density</em> of the universe during inflation. The density of a box of rocks goes down if the box gets bigger (and nothing enters or leaves the box). Double the size of the box and the density drops by a half. But wait! Stretching something with negative pressure stores energy within it, and thanks to E=em-cee-squared, this extra energy has mass. In an inflating universe, energy thins out as the universe gets bigger, but the negative pressure adds extra mass. For realistic models of inflation the density is almost constant -- the stretching of space adds energy almost as fast as the expansion dilutes it. The universe can grow a trillion, trillion, trillion times bigger during inflation but the density only falls by a factor of 1000 or so.</p>

 <p>Trying to get my friends and family into comics has been a rough journey. Comics are my favourite&nbsp;medium, but I will be the first to admit that they don't have the best reputation. Comics is an incredibly&nbsp;diverse and experimental medium, but their public image is so dominated by one spandex-clad genre&nbsp;that it's sometimes hard to get past, particularly in the representation of women. Luckily, we're living in&nbsp;a new golden age of comics that star women, are written by women, drawn by women, and are&nbsp;aimed at women. Everyday the medium is changing, becoming more inclusive and diverse, and there are&nbsp;more and more amazing titles to recommend to the curious and dubious new reader. Here's a few.</p>
 <h4>STRONG FEMALE PROTAGONIST</h4>

 <p>So, superheroes: fun as they are to watch and read about, aren't really equipped to tackle the real&nbsp;worlds ills, right? <em>"What are you going to do, Mega-Girl? Fling poverty into the sea? Smash us all into a&nbsp;better tomorrow?"</em> Mainstream comics do sometimes address this, and it's often cringe-worthy. But, the&nbsp;first rec on this list makes superhero ineffectiveness a central theme.<em> Strong Female Protagonist</em> is a&nbsp;smart, gorgeously drawn webcomic updating Tuesdays and Fridays, following the life of Alison Greene,&nbsp;aka Mega-Girl, formerly America's leading superheroine, physically invulnerable, and the strongest&nbsp;human being who has ever lived. She's also a twenty year old Uni student, who's desperately trying to&nbsp;find an identity for herself outside of heroics that defined her teenage years and to understand how she&nbsp;can more effectively help the world beyond punching people in the face.</p>
 <p>The comic explores the ethics of superheroing and social justice issues in a world just as messed up as&nbsp;our own. This can make for a pretty somber reading experience sometimes &mdash; <em>SFP</em> doesn't shy away from&nbsp;explicitly addressing homophobia, racism, poverty and privilege. Still, all these issues are treated with&nbsp;sincerity and honesty, and you never feel as if the writer and artist are using them for cheap shock value.&nbsp;And for all the darkness inherent in the stories themes, <em>SFP</em> doesn't come across as nihilistic. It's a&nbsp;fundamentally hopeful story, about continued action in the face of injustice and the importance of&nbsp;cooperation over individualism in tackling complicated issues. After all, you can't just kick homophobia&nbsp;through dimensions all on your own.</p>
 <p>You can find <em>SFP</em> <a href="http://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/">online</a>, where it is still ongoing, or find the first <a href="http://strongfemaleprotagonist.bigcartel.com/product/strong-female-protagonist-book-one">print volume</a>.</p>

 <p><em>Ms Marvel</em> began early last year, after the former Ms Marvel, Carol Danvers, claimed the title of Captain&nbsp;Marvel (actually a step down, she was a full Colonel when she left the Air Force. Lady outranks Captain&nbsp;America.). Kamala Khan of New Jersey is the "average girl" of the Tumblr age: obsessed with&nbsp;superheroes, writing fanfic, and stifling under parents who just don't understand how important this gifset is. She's also developing bizarre superpowers after exposure to a plot device. Inspired by her&nbsp;favourite superhero Captain Marvel and her inherent desire to do good, she sets out to protect the&nbsp;youth of New Jersey from various supervillains. Ridiculous teenage shenanigans ensue, iconic characters&nbsp;guest-star (Wolverine thinks Kamala is awesome), and writer G. Willow Wilson manages to intelligently&nbsp;and sensitively tie Kamalas Muslim faith to her heroic identity and motives. Kamala isn't defined by her&nbsp;faith, but it is an important aspect of her character and her life that the comic treats with utmost&nbsp;respect.</p>
 <p><em>Ms Marvel</em> is also a magnificent rebuttal to every "teenagers today are useless and lazy and will&nbsp;contribute nothing to the future" argument. Teenagers today are as varied and wonderful as the rest of&nbsp;the world, whatever out-of-touch baby boomers say. And let's be real, they didn't screw up the economy&nbsp;or fry the polar ice caps, but they are the ones who are going to have to live with it. I'll be honest, talking&nbsp;about Kamala and what a magnificent hero she is was about 98% of what motivated me to write this rec&nbsp;list. She's not Marvel's first female Muslim hero (X-Men has Dust and M, and Captain Britain has the&nbsp;delightful Dr Faiza Hussain, aka Excalibur), but is the first to headline her own ongoing title. <em>Ms Marvel</em> is&nbsp;about inspiration, hope, initiative and perseverance, doing what you can because it's RIGHT, to make a&nbsp;difference, even if it's hard, even if your parents don't like the giant space dog you just brought home.</p>

Where you contemplate your future, your present, your place in the world, and&nbsp;whether there is any real significance in any of it? You're not unique. Every high school student has&nbsp;those conversations, even students at a bizarre high school for vaguely defined magic and superpowers.&nbsp;<em>Super Mutant Magic Academy</em> is a collection of vignettes, short stories and one shot comics set in a high&nbsp;school that could be any high school. Yes, there are cute lizard girls and an immortal boy drifting through&nbsp;existence with blank faced ennui, but those aspects of the characters are secondary to their&nbsp;quintessential teenager-ness.</p>

 <p>Keiron Gillen, Matt Wilson and Jamie McKelvie are one of my favourite collaborative comic creator&nbsp;teams, and their current ongoing <em>The Wicked + The Divine</em> is possibly their greatest work together yet.&nbsp;Every 90 years, a Pantheon of twelve gods from various mythologies are reincarnated as young people.&nbsp;They live. They inspire. They are loved, hated, and without exception, within two years, they are all&nbsp;dead. The comic follows the Recurrence of 2014 through the eyes of Laura, a teenage fan, who finds&nbsp;herself embroiled in a murder mystery among the gods she idolizes. The twist is that the Pantheon of&nbsp;the 21st century embody the symbols of worship and adulation of the times... which of course means that&nbsp;here and now, they are pop idols. Part of the experience, outside of the luminous art and writing, is in&nbsp;recognising how each god echoes real world musicians &mdash; Lucifer resembles a 80s-era Bowie, Amaterasu is&nbsp;more than a little Florence Welch, and Baal is Kanye, with all the ego and OTT of the real thing.</p>
 <p>Celebrity is fleeting, and the lives of most of the main characters have a definite expiry date, which gives&nbsp;the series a sense of real immediacy as it questions ideas of fame, music and the power and meaning of&nbsp;both. The cast is wonderfully diverse as well, and the multitudes of women, queer characters and PoC in&nbsp;the story all have dimension and personality without having to fit into some imaginary diversity&nbsp;checklist. This is a series in which the literal incarnation of the Devil admits that transphobia is not okay.&nbsp;<em>WicDiv</em>, as it's fans affectionately call it, recently wrapped up its second story arc, with the series thus far&nbsp;collected in two trade Paperbacks.

 <p>It's a sad theme in fiction that all women hate each other. All women are constantly in competition with&nbsp;each other, for whatever the plot demands. Women can't support each other, or celebrate each others&nbsp;successes, they're too busy despising each other. Sigh. Female friendships can be some of the most&nbsp;fantastic, enriching and supportive relationships there are, and it's horrible how often they are&nbsp;misrepresented. FEMALE FRIENDSHIPS ARE GREAT. And <em>Lumberjanes</em> is a beautiful, hilarious, all ages&nbsp;testament to this, with the creedo 'Friendship to the Max', and a magnificent array of female friendships&nbsp;at the core of the comic.</p>
 <p>Set at a summer girl scout (not THE Girl Scouts) camp, <em>Lumberjanes</em> is a paranormal adventure in the vein&nbsp;of <em>Gravity Falls</em>, with a core cast of five friends who set out to unravel the mysteries of the surrounding&nbsp;woods... and get their merit badges for puns, make friendship bracelets, and goof off. I'm a Kiwi born and&nbsp;bred, so I can't speak for the summer camp experience, but I did attend an all girls school for five years,&nbsp;and the comic perfectly captures the camaraderie of girlhood and the friendships formed in&nbsp;adolescence. Lumberjanes also features several queer relationships, in both the main and supporting&nbsp;cast. The comic doesn't talk down to it's younger audience, and manages to deliver some simple,&nbsp;universal life lessons without ever being didactic or boring. This is a brilliant comic for young and old,&nbsp;and is a perfect entry point into comic reading.</p>
 <p>I would go on, and I'd love to go on eternally, but I don't want to keep you here. Go read some comics.</p>

 <p>And when you see that sexism is <em>systemic</em>, it becomes not enough to just make patriarchy work for you. Because not one of us lives in a vacuum. Our choices affect others, just as theirs affect us. And it&rsquo;s the people at the intersections of these systems &mdash; black women, trans women, for example &mdash; that bear the brunt of <em>our</em> choices.</p>
 <p><strong>And these aren&rsquo;t even our choices.</strong> Why do I feel empowered when I put on makeup? Would I have thought this had I not learned it at a young age? As children, television and movies show us what we should like. What we should feel empowered by. And growing up, these subconscious biases affect us every single day.</p>
 <p>This is the tricky part &mdash; doing nothing means upholding the status quo. It&rsquo;s what what makes these systems self-perpetuating, for the next generation, and the next, and the next.</p>

 <p>Let&rsquo;s approach this from a different angle.</p>
 <p>There&rsquo;s this thing in education called &ldquo;scaffolded learning&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s when you introduce a simple idea and get used to it. This idea might not be completely true, but in understanding it you prime your brain to better comprehend the more complex version.</p>
 <p>(I remember in high school, I got real mad that they taught us a simplified version of electrons around the atom. But then a couple of years later, I learned that electron shells were more like <em>solutions in 3-space to quantum energy functions</em>, so I kinda got why they started with 2, 8, 8.)</p>

 <p>We experience this because we&rsquo;re all at different places on this ramp. Maybe we think choice is the only thing that matters. Maybe we&rsquo;re working on dismantling the system.

 <p>When I look at this ramp &mdash; of feminism, of equality, of realisation &mdash; I see different ways of dealing with the society around us. Living within the system, or fighting against it.</p>
 <p>Surviving, or flourishing.</p>
 <p>We are all here because we realise there&rsquo;s something wrong in our industry. In other industries. In our communities. We are all here because we want to do something about it. Whether it be mending the pipeline, or supporting senior women. Whether it be creating and changing communities, or simply sitting down to listen. Whether it be surviving, or flourishing. Both are important. <strong>You can&rsquo;t flourish if you can&rsquo;t survive.</strong></p>
 <p>We are all also here because we are extremely lucky. We have time, we have resource, we have privilege.</p>
 <p>We have power. We can survive. And in our good times, we can flourish, too.</p>

 <p>I went from &lsquo;cool girl&rsquo;, to choice feminist, to seeing systemic and subconscious biases. I finally realised how learning about this is a process &mdash; a <em>ramp</em>. And a dialogue between us can only happen if we empathise with each other, no matter where we sit.</p>
 <p>And progress &mdash; as a community, as an industry &mdash; only happens when we take part in this dialogue. When we challenge others. <strong>When we challenge ourselves.</strong></p>
 <p>There&rsquo;s no question that we chose one of the hardest problems in history to solve. But it&rsquo;s also one of the most important.</p>

 <p>You see, when Quantum theory was first revealed, Einstein had a problem with it. He had a problem with the indeterminacy: the idea that before we measure something, it's everywhere and doing everything it possibly can. Not because we don't know, but because we <em>can't</em> know.</p>
 <p>It&rsquo;s probably worth going into the physics a little bit here so bear with me. For example, let's take an electron, the negatively charged sub-atomic particle that &ldquo;flies&rdquo; around the positively charged nucleus of an atom.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>

 <p>Now imagine we want to know something particular about it. Like, what's the spin? An electron will act as if it is spinning (spinning doesn&rsquo;t really doesn&rsquo;t really make sense for an elementary particle but it still has this property). The &lsquo;spinning&rsquo; can be either clockwise or counter-clockwise which we label up and down.</p>

 <p>This is where the word Quantum comes in, when we measure the spin of an electron it can only ever be these two values and nothing in between we say spin is quantised.&nbsp;As a classical analogy, that&rsquo;s like saying your car can only go 10km/hr or 20km/hr and nothing in between. Nonsense!</p>
 <p>But I glossed over a little point here, it&rsquo;s not that it can only BE up or down it&rsquo;s that we can only MEASURE up or down. The electron is often in a <em>superposition</em> of states until we measure it. This is an idea you may have heard of in terms of the thought experiment (or in German, Einstein&rsquo;s native tongue a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment">Gedanken</a>) <a href="http://www.iflscience.com/physics/schr%C3%B6dinger%E2%80%99s-cat-explained">Schroedinger&rsquo;s Cat</a>. &ldquo;The cat is both alive and dead until the box is opened&rdquo; is what people often take away from it. While this is not the correct interpretation of the problem it does help us to grasp the concept of superposition a little more easily. The particle is in this weird superposition of up and down until we measure it and it picks one.</p>
 <p>My car analogy breaks down here because it&rsquo;s not that the car can only go one of these two speeds it&rsquo;s that whenever we check the speedometer it &lsquo;jumps&rsquo; to either 10km/hr or 20km/hr.</p>
